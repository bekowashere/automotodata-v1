    "model_description": "BMW introduced the third generation of its smallest SAV, the X1, in 2022, and it was not only the smallest but also the most affordable crossover vehicle built by the German brand.When BMW launched the first generation of the X1 in 2009, it was a daring move that proved successful. Despite its narrow interior, it was an excellent car for those who needed a small vehicle for urban driving. It was also suitable enough for long trips. Unfortunately, since it was based on a platform fitted with a longitudinal engine, it couldn't offer too much interior space. But that was changed starting with the second generation, and, in 2009, the third reiteration gained more traction on the market.\n\nFor the exterior, BMW installed a pair of swept-back headlights that resembled those mounted on the 3 Series, with an option for adaptive LED headlamps. The massive front grille was not that big anymore. It looked almost normal for the car's size. The X1's profile revealed an ascending beltline that ended with the already famous \"Hofmeister Kink\" imagined back in the early 70s. Luckily, the design team created the 2022 X1 to look more like an SUV than a regular station wagon.\n\nInside, the X1 revealed an elegant cabin with a curved display that showed the data needed by the driver fronting the steering wheel. At the same time, the infotainment unit placed atop the center stack gave the impression of a single, continuous panel. Moreover, thanks to the front-wheel-drive architecture and the transverse-mounted engine, the carmaker could offer a wider interior space.\n\nThe 2022 X1 covered all the bases with either front or rear-wheel drive, with gasoline or turbo-diesel engines under the hood. In addition, all versions benefited from the 48v mild-hybrid technology."

    "model_description": "For 2016,  BMW started from scratch with the X1 compact crossover.The new model rides on another platform, looks more menacing and offers more space.\n\nDesign wise, you can clearly see the 2016 X1 got in line with the rest of the Xs in BMW's stable. Different grille, frowned headlights and a gaping trapezoidal lower air intake help create that virtual X the automaker uses on all its SUVs. The greenhouse is taller now and seems a bit longer too while the rear comes with LED taillamps and twin tailpipes.\n\nFor the interior you get the same instrument as on the 2 Series Active Tourer, as well as the same steering wheel and gear shifter, while the standard feature list will contain air conditioning, audio system with multiple connectivity, auto wipers, Servotronic and the 6.5-inch iDrive system with Driving Experience Control switch.\n\nMechanically, you should know that the 2016 BMW X1 shares its platform with the 2 Series Active Tourer, which means it comes either in FWD or AWD, while being motivated by a number of all-new engines."

Headroom and legroom were good for both the front and the rear passengers. \n\nThe luggage compartment could be increased from 420 L to 1,350 L with the rear seats folded.\n\nSafety wise, the X1 was equipped with Dynamic Stability Control, an optional Performance Control and frontal and side airbags. Optionally, buyers could add xenon headlights, adaptive headlights and a high-beam assistant.\n\nThe X1 came with the latest generation of the BMW iDrive system combined with the optional Business and Professional navigation.\n\nThe X1 had a great handling with a precise steering, and, even if the steering was a bit heavy at lower speeds, it offered great feedback at higher speeds.\n\nThe X1\u2019s starting price was at $43,000, however, the optional features were not the cheapest to add."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced a facelifted version for the 8th Series' second generation in 2022, and it offered it with the M-treatment for every body shape.But the brand's purists couldn't choose anything else than the coupe version.\n\nWhen the first generation of the 8-Series, the E31, was unveiled, BMW's fans asked for an M-version. The carmaker worked on that, made the prototype, and then hid it into storage, where it remained forever. But with the second generation of the 8-Series, which happened in 2018, the carmaker didn't avoid the high-performance version for it and made the M8 Competition. Moreover, it offered it on all three body styles: Coupe, Convertible, and Gran Coupe.\n\nLike the rest of the facelifted range, the M8 Competition showed up with the M-specific front bumper that featured a wide air intake on the front apron, flanked by two scoops that cooled the brakes. To release the air trapped inside the wheel-well, the carmaker added an extracting vent on each side of the vehicle, on the front fenders. The hood featured two longitudinal bulges, like a warning for V-engine underneath it. Unlike the rest of the range, the M8 Competition came fitted as standard with 20\" light-alloy wheels.\n\nThe interior was upgraded, and the most striking difference was for the infotainment screen, which stood atop the center stack. Unlike the non-facelifted version, it featured a standard 12.3\" display instead of the older 10.25\" units used before. The interior is upholstered in Merino leather/Alcantara as standard, with either M sport seats or M carbon bucket seats, depending on the option.\n\nUnder the hood, the V8 twin-turbo powerplant delivered enough performance to chase most supercars from its era. As usual, the coupe version was a little bit quicker on the 0-62 mph (0-100 kph) run than the convertible."

    "model_description": "Revealed at the same time as the M8 Convertible, the first ever BMW M8 Coupe is powered by \"the most powerful engine ever developed for a BMW M GmbH car,\" which was borrowed straight from the monstrous BMW M5.The 4.4-liter, twin-turbocharged V8 develops 600 horsepower and 750 Nm of torque in the base model and 625 horsepower in the M8 Competition versions, which are identical numbers with the M5 donor.\n\nAlso taken straight out of the M5 is the M xDrive all-wheel-drive system with a rear-based setup and Active M Differential, sending the power to either all four wheels or just the rear ones via a ZF-sourced eight-speed automatic gearbox. Just like the M5, the M8 can be driven either in the default 4WD setting or 4WD Sport mode, which sends a lot more power to the rear wheels. When the DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) is deactivated, the model becomes a pure 2WD car. The normal M8 Coupe can go from 0 to 100 kph (62 mph) in 3.3 seconds, while the 200 kph (124 mph) speed is clocked in 10.8 seconds. The M8 Competition is slightly faster, with the 0-100 kph time taking only 3.2 seconds and the 200 kph speed being hit in 10.6 seconds."

    "model_description": "BMW refreshed the 8 series lineup in 2022, after four years since the car's initial launch in 2018.It was a mild facelift for the car that revived a '90s nameplate in the German carmaker stable.\n\nAfter BMW revived the 6 series in 2003 and used that name for two generations, it continued with the 8, resembling one of the greatest GT vehicles made by the Bavarian brand. With all the dots connected, the 2022 model came as its non-facelifted version in three flavors: coupe, convertible, and gran coupe (four doors).\n\nThe car came with the same elongated silhouette and a sloped roofline that emerged to the trunk lid for the coupe version. In addition, BMW offered an option for a carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) roof. A double-bubble design was also adopted, with a central indentation that crossed the car from the windscreen to the rear window. Starting with the 2022 model, all 8-Series models came fitted with an M-package, with a V-shaped center grille in the bumper flanked by two wide scoops that channeled the air to the front discs. On the sides, behind the wheel-wells, BMW installed extracting vents.\n\nThe classic dashboard layout with a rectangular instrument cluster and a driver-oriented center stack featured two digital displays: a TFT for the dials and gauges and a touch-screen for the infotainment unit. The tall center console separated the front seats, creating a single-seat sensation for the driver.\n\nUnder the hood, surprisingly, BMW still offered a turbodiesel version for its elegant and fast grand tourer. Yet, it enhanced it with a hybrid system to get lower CO2 emissions, in line with the 2022 requirements. Power went to the rear or both axles, depending on the version."

    "model_description": "Unveiled as a higher end replacement of its 6 Series Coupe predecessor, the second-generation BMW 8 Series Coupe and the first modern iteration of the \"8\" moniker was unveiled in 2018.Despite the new nomenclature it has adopted and its increased price range, the model's size and features are reminiscent of the previous 6 Series. Going head-to-head with established luxury 2+2 grand tourers like the Bentley Continental GT or the Mercedes-Benz S-Class Coupe, the new BMW 8 Series Coupe play the performance card instead of all-out luxury. \n\nBuilt at BMW's Dingolfing plant alongside the BMW 7 Series, the luxury coupe is part of a three-model family that includes a convertible versions and a four-door coupe. Depending on engine version, the 8 Series is available with either an intelligent xDrive AWD system or with rear-wheel-drive on the entry-level models. Turbocharged inline-six gasoline and diesel engines are available, with the top models being exclusively powered by twin-turbocharged gasoline V8 powerplants. Despite going against true luxury coupes that come without a B-pillar, the 8 Series Coupe has one, with the rear side windows being fixed. While a bit low to offer ample head room, especially for the rear passengers, the roof can be optionally ordered in carbon-fiber-reinforced-plastic (CFRP), which is not only the first such option on a production BMW but also helps lower the model's center of gravity."

    "model_description": "BMW refreshed the seventh generation of the 3 Series in 2022 and, besides the sedan, the station wagon was upgraded as well.In 1985, BMW introduced a station wagon version for the 3 Series, named Touring. It was a big hit for the German carmaker, especially since there were not too many choices for premium station wagons in the compact segment.\n\nThe carmaker revised the car's exterior by introducing new, narrower headlights that were available with adaptive LEDs. Moreover, the car received a few options for the front bumpers, including an option for the M Sport Package and M Sport Package Pro. The latter was newly introduced for the lineup. While the aggressive design was nothing unusual for the sedan, the station wagon usually was not that daring. On the sides, the blacked-out B- and C-pillars tried in vain to resemble a shooting brake. At the back, the available diffuser completed the car's sporty look together with the roof spoiler mounted on top of the tailgate. \n\nInside, the most significant change was on the dashboard, which featured the BMW Curved Display. In addition, the carmaker installed a 12.3\" instrument panel in front of the panel and an additional 14.9\" infotainment screen above the center stack. This came with the BMW Operating System 8. As for the trunk space, nothing changed when compared with the 2019 3 Series Touring.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW installed a wide choice of engines, ranging between 148 hp (150 PS) and 369 hp (374 PS), with either four or six cylinders fed by gasoline or diesel. Moreover, a plug-in hybrid version was also available. Depending on the engine version and options, the power went to the rear or in all corners via a manual or an automatic transmission."

    "model_description": "After more than three decades and 1.7 millions cars on the road, BMW brought out the 2019 3 series Touring, the sixth generation of the model. The new station wagon is longer by 76 mm (3 in), reaching a total of 4709 mm (15.4 ft) compared to its predecessor. The wheelbase was increased by 41 mm (1.61 in), thus giving more room for the occupants. The trunk has been increased to a total volume of 500 liters (17.65 cu-ft), which can triple by folding down the rear seats to a total of 1510 liters (53.3 cu-ft).\n\nInside, the premium feeling is obvious due to the high quality of the materials used, especially if the vehicle is fitted with upper trim levels. A panoramic glass roof is offered as an option to increase the light and atmosphere inside. For the infotainment system, BMW added its newest generation of iDrive.\n\nFor the headlights, BMW offers LED fitted as standard with another upgraded LED system available for extra money and, for those who really wants to transform night into a day, the Laserlight, which can light-up the road ahead up to 530 m (1739 ft).\n\nFor the engine compartment, BMW installed a base unit with four-cylinders, a 150 hp turbodiesel. The top-version is the M340i with a six-cylinder 3.0-liter unit, which offers 374 hp. An all-wheel-drive system (called xDrive) is available only for engines with power from 190 hp up. "

    "model_description": "In 2016, BMW introduced the facelift for the sixth generation of the 3-Series for all the range, including the station-wagon.Along with some subtle exterior changes, there were some technological upgrades.\n\nApart from the first generation of the 3-series, all the others were offered with a station-wagon bodywork as well. That would make the F31 the fifth-generation of the Touring version for the 3-Series. The generation was introduced at the 21st Auto Mobil International held at Leipzig in 2012 and it was updated four years later.\n\nFor the exterior, the LCI (Life-Cycle Impulse) introduced a new apron with revised air-intakes. The sensor for the optional Active Cruise Control (ACC) was integrated into the central air-intake. For the headlights, a new full-LED option was added to the list. In the rear, a new apron and new standard LED lights were installed.\n\nOn the inside, there was a newly crafted center console with a sliding cover for the cup-holders, that was better used for mobile phones. The instrument cluster featured the same four-dials gauges, accompanied on the center stack by a widescreen for the infotainment unit. In the rear, the split-folding seats allowed up to 1500 liters (53 cu-ft) of trunk space if the usual 496 liters (17.5 cu-ft) volume was not enough.\n\nFor the engines, 2016 3 Series Touring was available with a choice of gasoline and turbocharged diesel engines, mated to either a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic. The standard transmission was rear-wheel drive while specific versions were fitted with all-wheel-drive."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced the sixth generation of the 3 Series sedan in late 2011, but, even though it had the station wagon version ready to launch, it did that in 2012.Ever since the second generation of the 3 Series, BMW understood that customers needed a station wagon for their premium compact vehicle. Moreover, it had to offer a few things that no other automaker could provide. And the Bavarian automaker kept improving the vehicle and reached more and more customers. Moreover, to make the long-roof more desirable, it gave it exclusive options, such as the opening panoramic glass roof.\n\nWith the sixth generation of the 3 Series, BMW returned to its initial quest of designing the car with sportier styling. Thus, thanks to the narrowed headlights on the inner side, it made it look sportier. Like its sedan sibling, the Touring version, BMW's designation for station wagons, the F31 sported a broad grille on the lower side of the bumper that also included the foglamps. On the profile, the slightly sloped-down roof and the raked-forward tailgate created a dynamic look of the vehicle.\n\nInside, at the front, there were no differences between the sedan and its family-oriented stablemate. At the same time, the rear bench featured a 40/20/40 split-folding system that allowed an increase in the trunk space from a decent 495 liters (17.5 cu-ft) to a respectable 1,500 liters (53 cu-ft). But this wasn't the only advantage when compared to its four-door sibling. The Touring also provided better headroom for the rear passengers, although the transmission tunnel limited the legroom for the middle-seated occupant.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW offered a wide engine choice for the 3 Series Touring customers. Power ranged between a mere 134 hp (136 PS) and 302 hp (306 PS). Depending on the engine version, the car was available with either a six-speed manual or an eight-speed automatic. In addition, the automaker offered a choice of rear- or all-wheel drive systems."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced a mid-life cycle refresh for the whole 3-Series range in 2008 and improved the station wagon version named Sports Wagon in North America or Touring in Europe.The German carmaker had to improve its cars to fit into the Euro 5a emission standards. Since it had to refresh the engines, it added other modifications to the car's exterior and interior. Worth mentioning that the 3-Series was the best-selling BMW model globally.\n\nAt the front, the main difference was on the company's \"kidney\" grille design, which featured rounded interior edges instead of the clear-cut style used before. BMW also included the grille's chromed top rim in the front fascia, not on the hood as it was on the pre-facelifted version. The lower bumper area received a smiling cut instead of the straight one. Further modifications followed in the rear, where the new LED taillights featured smaller reversing lights.\n\nInside, the most visible change was for the automatic transmission selector. On the 2008 model, BMW adopted the joy-stick system used on the bigger brother 5-Series instead of the classic, linear style with a side gate for the manual mode. The 40/20/40 split-folding bench in the rear allowed the trunk to increase its size from 460 liters (16.2 cu-ft) to 1,385 liters (48.9 cu-ft)\n\nUnder the hood, the German carmaker offered a vast engine choice and started it with a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated gasoline unit that provided 136 hp, seven more than its predecessor. For turbo-diesel versions, BMW introduced a fuel-efficient 115 hp unit paired with a 6-speed manual. The carmaker renamed the all-wheel-drive versions as xDrive instead of xD or xI as before."

    "model_description": "After the great success the Bavarian manufacturer had with the 4th generation of the 3-series, namely the E46, BMW decided it was time for a brand new model that would still turn heads.The new 3-series, also named E90 (sedan), E91 (touring), E92 (coupe) and E93 (cabriolet) had a completely redesigned body, using lines inspired from the 5-series. \n\nCompared to the E46, the new model came with a larger wheelbase, thus enhancing passenger comfort. BMW claimed that the boot size was also better, however, the spare tire disappeared starting with 2005. The new 3-series ran on run-flat tires and such the storage space was increased.\n\nThe new E90\u2019s body was by 25% stiffer than the older\u2019s model and, of course, safety was enhanced. Other safety features included ABS, dynamic stability control, traction control and others.\n\nSpecific to the brand, the timeless design of the E90 attracted buyers for many years, while still keeping its value.\n\nComing with a variety of engines, the new model could satisfy the needs of every driver. While most of the powerplants were punchy, the fuel consumption was kept as low as possible.\n\nAnd while it\u2019s not always about how many ponies are to be found under the hood, the E90 offered a great driving experience with its precise steering and great handling. \n\nAs we like to say, the BMWs were and still are designed for the most pretentious drivers."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced a facelifted version of its 3-Series in 2001 and improved it to match its main competitor, the C-Class from Mercedes.Ever since the 3-Series E30, BMW offered its compact segment contender in a station wagon shape, fit for those who needed a car for the family but didn't want to give up to the sporty rear-wheel-drive feeling. When the E46 (fourth generation) came on the market in 1998, the Touring (station wagon) was already planned. By 2001, the car's image was already old, and the carmaker already had the refreshed version cooked and ready to go.\n\nFrom the outside, there were minor changes to the bodywork. The distinctive new look of the headlights, with a double curved line on the bottom, matched the new bumper. At the back, there were no changes to the taillights or the bumper.\n\nInside, the carmaker introduced new options for steering wheels and installed paddle shifters for the automated (SMG) transmission. The center console received more buttons for additional safety equipment (Dynamic Stability Control). A significant improvement was for the infotainment unit, which received a color screen for the navigation system.\n\nThe most important change was for the drivetrain, where a new engine lineup was introduced. The base model was a 1.8-liter unit, named 316i, which offered 115 hp. The most popular version was the 318i, which offered a 2.0-liter unit rated at 143 hp. It was the first 2.0-liter with four cylinders installed on a BMW since the first generation. Top of the range version was the 231 hp 3.0-liter unit, which could have been mated to a 6-speed manual with a rear or all-wheel-drive system. All versions were available with an automatic, 5-speed transmission."

    "model_description": "In the late '90s, the station wagon market in Europe was high.After the big success of the BMW 3 Series Touring (station wagon) for the previous E36 generation, the BMW board decided to make a sequel. So, the 3 series touring appeared. But in the U.S., the demand for premium compact station wagons was low. So it built it with only two engine variants, both of 2.5-liter inline 6 and one of them was approved as a SULEV vehicle (super ultra low emission vehicle). In Europe, the engine offer was much wider, including turbodiesel units and other displacements. It was available even with a 1.8-liter version, which was, actually, kind of weak for the over 1.5-ton vehicle.\n\nWhen the E46 appeared, it had the longest wheelbase in the compact market. Its 2.7 m (107\u201d) long-wheelbase should have been translated into more room for the rear passengers. But, since the engine was mounted longitudinally, they didn't have enough. It was just ok.\n\nBut the 3 series E46 touring model was important for another thing. Due to a big demand for the station wagon with an all-wheel-drive system (325 iX and 330 iX), BMW understood that it is time for a small SUV. And that's how the X3 was born."

    "model_description": "The second generation of the 3-Series was launched in 1982 but it wasn't until the car's mid-life cycle refresh until the station-wagon was launched.It was the first 3-Series that had the Touring name.\n\nThe station-wagon mania started in the mid-'80s and the premium manufacturers didn't offer that kind of bodywork on the compact-sized vehicles. While Mercedes-Benz and Audi already had station-wagons in its lineup, BMW didn't have anything to offer in that segment.\n\nThe 3-Series touring was the same car from the grille to the B-pillars, but after that, it was changed with a longer roof, different rear quarter panels, and the addition of the D-pillars. The C-pillars were slimmer than those from the sedan. The tailgate featured an innovative system with the window opening independently from the rest of the tailgate, or together with it.\n\nInside, there was no difference in headroom between the sedan and the touring since the sedan already featured a long roof. The rear seats featured a folding seatback to extend the trunk space. It also kept the go-through folding panel to allow ski-transport.\n\nThe 3-Series Touring was offered with 4 and 6 cylinders engines, both gasoline and diesel. The introduction of the all-wheel-drive system for the 325 iX version was also introduced for the station-wagon."

    "model_description": "BMW refreshed the entire range of the 8-Series in 2022, and that included the open-top version as well, adding more refinement, more technology, and small design cues to the beautiful drop-top grand tourer.The first generation of the 8-Series, the E 31, was introduced by the carmaker in 1990. In its coupe version, it was an instant success despite its high price. Its only flaw was that it was not available as a convertible. Later on, after it was withdrawn from the market, the coupe version gained traction. In 2018, the carmaker decided to re-launch the respectable nameplate and give it a second chance. This time, it did all the things right.\n\nFor the refreshed version, BMW applied an M aerodynamic package to the whole range. Its front bumper featured a V-shaped grille in bumper, flanked by the air-scoops that channeled the air to the front brake discs. Behind the wheel-wells, a set of extracting vents helped the vehicle decrease the drag resistance. For the roof, BMW opted for a classic fabric top. Like the non-facelifted version, the car needed just 15 seconds from the top up to top-down. Inside the cabin, there was hardly room enough for four passengers.\n\nUnder the hood, surprisingly, BMW still offered a turbodiesel version for its elegant and fast grand tourer. Yet, it enhanced it with a hybrid system to get lower CO2 emissions, in line with the 2022 requirements. Power went to the rear or both axles, depending on the version."

Only two engines were available at first, both being paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission and xDrive all-wheel-drive.\n The 840d xDrive Convertible used a 3.0-liter diesel with two sequential turbos and has a 320 hp and 680 Nm (505.5 lb-ft) of torque. The M850i xDrive, on the other hand, featured a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 gasoline mill with 530 hp and 750 Nm (553.2 lb-ft) of torque.\nThe interior of the car was very well thought and BMW concentrated on the quality of materials. \nThe infotainment system consisted of a 10.3 inch touchscreen which was the best on the market at that time. Voice control was standard and the car was equipped with Apple CarPlay. Android auto was not offered. \nThe seats were very comfortable and were offered with lots of adjustments. Due to their low position and the high window line, the driver did not have as much visibility, however, the car was equipped with front and rear parking sensors, a rear-view camera and LED headlights as standard."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced a facelifted version of its flagship SUV, the X7, in 2022 and gave it a reworked look and updated powertrains.Designed as a premium seven-seat vehicle, the biggest SUV made by the German carmaker from Munchen competed against its classic rival Mercedes-Benz GLS and, on American soil, with Cadillac Escalade. But like the three-pointed-star brand, it came with unibody construction, lowering the overall weight.\n\nThe design language was similar to the one found on the 7 Series. It sported a huge kidney-grille design, which raged most of the brand's fans. Actually, only about 20% agreed with them, according to BMW, but they gave it a shot anyway. The full-LED headlights were deeply buried inside the upper side of the bumper and were complemented by daytime running lights above them, like a pair of eyebrows.\n\nInside, BMW refreshed some of the materials and the technique used. Thus, thanks to the newly developed mats and roof, the cabin ensured superior acoustic comfort. Moreover, the carmaker offered the X7 in a six-seat configuration, with two captain seats in the middle row, while the rearmost passengers were greeted by two comfortable seats.\n\nLike its predecessor, the 2022 X7 was exclusively available as an all-wheel drive vehicle. The powertrains came from either an inline-six turbodiesel or a V8. Both versions were paired to an eight-speed automatic transmission with integrated electric assistance for the mild-hybrid system."

    "model_description": "BMW finally decided to enter the 7-seat SUV market with the 2018 X7, a vehicle that was a direct competitor with the Mercedes-Benz GLS and the Audi Q7.When the BMW launched its first X5 in 1999, it built a factory for that car in the U.S. It was the instant hit of the year. With some technology carried-over from the Land Rover, the X5 sales skyrocketed. Unlike the ML, it featured a unibody bodywork, and that made it lighter. The same goes for the X7, which is, actually, a bigger X5.\n\nThe front of the car was the most debatable part of the vehicle. The big grille didn't look like a pair of kidneys anymore. They were just huge with vertical slats that could open and close to help the thermal management of the engine. On the sides, the doors were big enough to allow comfortable access inside.\n\nThe cabin was inspired by the 7-Series model, with ample space for every passenger. All of the 7 seats in the car were upholstered in leather. A three-piece glass roof was available, ensuring a light interior and an airy feeling for the passengers. The newly designed display grouping which came as part of the standard-fitted BMW Live Cockpit Professional included a Control Display and a fully-digital instrument cluster of 12.3\u201d each.\n\nFor the engine department, the BMW X7 was fitted with two gasoline units and a 3.0-liter diesel offered in two versions, one being fitted with four turbochargers. The standard transmission was an 8-speed automatic."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced the seventh generation of its flagship model, the 7 Series, shocking the world with its new design but pleasing everyone with the new technologies offered.After almost half of century since the launch of the 7 Series' first generation, the German carmaker introduced the seventh sequel of this lineup. It came with lots of innovations and, for the first time, a fully electric version aimed against the EQS from its traditional competitor, Mercedes-Benz.\n\nWhen BMW launched the 2001 model-year 7 Series, it rocked the world with its disruptive design. Most people didn't like it, but it was the best-selling 7 Series until then. Two decades later, the 2022 model year tried to walk into its ancestors' shoes and featured an intriguing design. Its front fascia sported the tallest and widest grille ever mounted on the German brand flagship model. Moreover, the LED daytime running lights were installed very high and looked like eyebrows above the LED headlights buried deep into the upper side of the bumper, flanking the massive grille. Lower, on the apron, the carmaker added another set of grilles and air-intakes. Another shocking detail was the reinterpreted design element, known as the Hofmeister kink, which sported an angular shape at the bottom of the C-pillar.\n\nInside, the car featured a 12.3\" display behind the steering wheel and, in addition, another 14.9\" touchscreen for the infotainment system. Both of them were covered under a common glass, giving the impression of a very long, continuous display. The 2022 7 Series also featured a standard Panoramic Sky Lounge LED roof, which consisted of a single, fixed glass surface surrounded by a steel frame, covered by an electrically operated interior sliding shade. The comfort and luxury level of this new Bavarian flagship was enhanced with a plethora of options, including a 31.3\" 8K touchscreen display fitted with Amazon Fire TV.\n\nUnder the hood, right from the start, the 2022 7 Series offered a choice of three engines. The base version featured a new, Miller-cycle, twin-turbo inline-six aided by a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. Next in line was the 760i version with a 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8, while the most important addition was the i7 xDrive60, the first full-electric 7 Series in history."

    "model_description": "The big 7-series from BMW has received a mid-life cycle refresh in 2019, and it featured numerous upgrades, from the hood to the bottom, inside and outside the car.Most of the vehicle's parts were either changed or upgraded. A new hood, new front fenders, new headlights, and new grille were offered for the 2019 BMW 7 Series LCI (Life Cycle\n Impulse). The air breathers on the front fenders were designed to extract the air from the wheel-well, in order to reduce the aerodynamic lift of the car. In the rear, there was a full-width light strip, with a LED-strip.\n\nInside, the luxury was obvious and the two options for wheelbases could add more legroom for the rear passengers. For the facelifted model, full Nappa leather and BMW Individual Merino full leather with extended quilting were available. \n\nThe engine and transmission range was revised. For the hybrid version, a new xDrive system was available as an option. And, for the 8-speed automatic transmission, a launch-control mode was installed. For those who live their lives one-quarter mile at a time, the 6.0-liter V12 was still available, and with all-wheel-drive. One of the biggest changes in the engine bay was the 4.4-liter V8 unit. It had a pair of twin-scroll turbochargers installed between the two cylinder banks for faster response. It also gained 80 more hp compared to the engine it replaces and had a maximum output of 530 hp. In the 750i xDrive, the two-ton limousine cand sprint from 0 to 100 kph (0-62 mph) in 4 seconds flat."

The same story goes for the interior too, with the model receiving redesigned seats, dashboard, and extra features, especially for the rear occupants. \n\nCount in a night-sky-replicating panoramic roof with 15.000 LEDs, a new iDrive system, a 7-inch detachable tablet, massage seats, gesture control, Traffic Jam Assistant, remote parking, Laserlight headlamps and a lot more.\n\nUnder the hood, there are new engines with added power and better efficiency as well as a revised 8-speed automatic transmission. CFRP is used along with aluminum for weight reduction and all models now get a 2-axle self-leveling air suspension.\n\nThe 7 series is available with either rear-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive xDrive system. The available engines are either inline-6 cylinders or V8s, diesel, gasoline or as plug-in hybrid for the BMW 740e with four-cylinders and an electric motor with a total output power of 326 hp. A 12-cylinder M760i completed the lineup later."

    "model_description": "The 7 series from BMW was on the market since 1977 and after many generations, it didn't change its basic idea: a luxury car for the driver.When the fifth generation of the 7 Series was launched in 2008 it was the big step away from the generation designed in the Chris Bangle era. The new look and the technical updates already transformed the car into a luxurious, fast, limousine that was nice to drive and comfortable on the back-seats.\n\nIn 2012, a mid-life cycle refresh was needed. The pollution norms were changed and new technologies should have been included in the BMW flagship vehicle. The exterior changes were not so important. There was a new pair of LED headlights on the front, with a redesigned bumper. The radiator grille had fewer slats on it. In the rear, the LED taillights were connected via a chromed strip.\n\nInside there were some significant changes in the front as well. For the 2012 7-Series, there was an option for an instrument cluster with a 10.25\" black screen that replaced the analog gauges and dials. That brought some changes for the interior lighting that allowed different themes on the dashboard, related to the driving mode chosen by the driver. \n\nFor the back-seats, depending on the trim level and the options, the rear passenger was able to change the music or set-up the navigation system via an iDrive rotary-knob located in the center armrest. The new 750 d xDrive and the BMW 730d were equipped to comply with the Euro 6 emission limits."

    "model_description": "The fifth generation of the BMW's flagship sedan, the 7-Series, was introduced in 2008 and it debuted into a hard time, during the world economic crisis.But it couldn't wait any longer.\n\nWith the fifth generation, the 7-Series lost the older model coding with the \u201cE\u201d letter and passed to the new, F-Series cod names. The fifth-generation has received the F01/F02 name for that generation. It also was a change for the design language of the Bavarian brand.\n\nThe 2008 7-Series was the departure from the \u201cBangle\u201d design of its predecessor and the return to a, somehow traditional design. The big headlights were not round or straight but shaped specifically to make a connection between the bumper and the front fenders. The grille with its kidneys was not integrated into the hood but kept in place along with the front fascia. Long, ample straight lines gave a visual sense of length for the vehicle.\n\nInside, there was a new interior with horizontal lines for the dashboard which were continued on the door panels. The technological package of the car was big. It featured a new infotainment system with an evolved iDrive. The instrument cluster offered a mix of analog and digital display, preparing its customers for the next series. Up to five video cameras were available to help the driver. One was for infrared forward view, two were mounted on the front fenders to look left and right, one was for reversing and another one looked for the traffic signs. The interior room was big, especially for the long-wheelbase version.\n\nUnder the hood, the 7-Series offered turbocharged gasoline and diesel units, available with rear or all-wheel-drive via a standard 8-speed automatic transmission."

    "model_description": "BMW refreshed its flagship model, the 7 Series, in 2005, enhancing both the look and the powertrain of its vehicle, and became Euro 4 compliant.Despite its polarizing design, the BMW 7 Series (E65/E66) was the best-selling 7 Series of all time. While some argued that this was due to the incorporated technologies, others might say that it was the design that grabbed the attention of new kinds of customers, who didn't really enjoy the classic look of the 7 Series anymore.\n\nTo silence more voices that screamed against Chris Bangle, who led the design department even though he didn't create the car's look, BMW drastically improved the 7 Series' look. At the front, the double-curved line on the headlamps' bottoms was not as shocking as before. Instead, it was more like a slight, double-waved line. Another important upgrade was for the rear end, where there were changes on the taillights and the panel, making them look smoother. \n\nInside, the carmaker introduced a new generation of the infotainment system, dubbed iDrive, and provided more features apart from just connecting the phone via Bluetooth and navigation. It was standard across the range. The revolutionary turning knob between the front seats allowed access to more functions. A pair of buttons for switching gears was installed on the steering wheel's rim, depending on the options. As before, the E65 offered enough room for four passengers, while the long-wheelbase version, named E66, provided Business-class-like legroom.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW offered new or enhanced engines, including the 4.8-liter powerplant also found in the X5 4.8is version. The six-speed automatic transmission was the only option on the entire range."

    "model_description": "\nThe fourth generation of the BMW 7-Series was one of the most hated and loved 7-series from all times.It was hated for its look, but it was the car that was outsold its predecessors.\n\nWith the E65 BMW 7-Series, the design-guru from the German car-makers, Chris Bangle, launched a new design style in the company. It was named \u201cflame-surfacing\u201d and, in theory, made the car look different depending on the angle it was seen. On the other hand, it was the most advanced technological car on the road and it received a prize for that in Japan.\n\nWhen compared to its sleek predecessor, the E65/E66 7-Series was bulky and big and with a huge grille in the front. It wasn't sleek anymore and it wants to get attention on the road. The front bumper had to be sculptured to completely reveal the headlights while the rear end featured an arched quarter-panel which was not followed by the trunk lid's shape.\n\nInside, the technology involved was overwhelming for those times. It was the first time when an infotainment system was controlled via a rotary knob that did all the commands. The system was developed in partnership with the Nokia phone manufacturer. The double-bulged dashboard, one for the instrument cluster and one for the infotainment screen, was another design issue found by the BMW fans.\n\nIn the back, it offered good legroom and plenty of it if the long-wheelbase (E66) version was chosen. The BMW 7-Series was available with a choice of gasoline and diesel engines from inline-six up to V12 units. It was the first BMW available exclusively with an automatic transmission."

    "model_description": "The refreshed version of the 3rd generation BMW 7-series was released in 1998, offering new improved features and a more sophisticated design.The facelift included revised headlights, new taillights, sportier suspension, new wheels and a torque converter. Also, BMW launched a new sports package that was initially available for the 740i version but later optional for both 740iL and 750iL variants (long wheelbase). The 728i engines were upgraded and featured variable valve timing.\n\n Some other new features on the improved 7 Series included an automatic climate control system, front side airbags and a standard Head Protection System. The DSC came as a standard feature. Moreover, the facelift brought a new feature named \u201cActive Comfort Seats\u201d that was developed for fatigue reduction for both the driver and the front passenger. The head airbags became a standard safety feature.\n\nUntil 1998, the 740iL had a 4.4-liter V8 engine developing 286 hp and 499 nM, however, the facelift model had the same engine with an increased torque of 440 nM.\n\nThe trunk space was a generous 500 L and that\u2019s only one of the reasons that made it an ideal car for long family trips. The 7 Series offered reliability, top-notch comfort, space and luxury.\n\nThe E38-based 7 Series was discontinued in 2001, as it was replaced by the 4th generation model (E65/66)."

And all this length is added for the rear passenger's comfort. For this special version, the customization was taken to a different level for a production vehicle.\n\nThe vehicle was available with two or three seats in the back. If two seats were selected, a big, central console was installed. It included a small refrigerator, cupholders, separate climate control unit and the buttons for rear-seat heating. \n\nThe right-rear passenger had the option to control the right front seat via buttons in the central console. If the passenger needed, he could move the right seat forward, recline it and lower the headrest. \n\nThe car could also feature a communication center. The mobile phone technology was not new anymore, but not a common service either. Still, the L7 could have a Fax-machine in the back. On the optional separating panel between the front and rear seats and install a TV.\n\nFrom the technical point of view, the V12 engine and transmission were standard. It featured the same 5-speed automatic transmission, but with different settings for smoother gear changes. The pneumatic suspension was adjustable, either for a smooth ride or firm, just in case of a getaway run."

It also was the first production model BMW fitted with a V12 engine. It was a sum of comfort, luxury, and sportiness. And on top of that, it was also very fuel-efficient, when equipped with the 2.5-liter diesel engine, which was not available for the North-American market.\n\nThe car featured an unusually low height, seen only on the Jaguar XJ series. The car was fitted with dual headlamps covered under a clear-lens, with halogen or Xenon lights. It was available with a short or long wheelbase. For special order, the 7-Series was available with an extra-long wheelbase, for state and government officials, named L7.\n\nInside, the car featured five seats but due to the low height of the cabin and the high transmission tunnel, only two passengers could sit comfortably in the rear seats. There were few options for the sound system and even a telephone was installed between the front seats as an option.\n\nFor the engines, the German engineers offered a wide choice between 2.5-liter turbodiesel unit and a 5.4-liter gasoline V8 unit. Apart from the top of the range model, named 750i, the other versions were available with a 5- or 6-speed manual transmission. The only automatic transmission was a 5-speed, for the entire range."

    "model_description": "The BMW 7-Series E32 was the first V12 car produced in Germany after WWII and at the time of its appearance in 1986 it was the most technologically advanced vehicle on the market.The battle for the luxury segment was on the way between the two German giants Mercedes-Benz and BMW. The latter introduced the second generation of the 7-Series in June 1986 with a shy, inline-six engine. The manufacturer knew that over the time the car will need more power and they offered that with the V8 and V12 engines later on. \n\nThe design sketches started in 1979 and the final project was ready in 1984. But the BMW management held the project for another two years. In June 1986 the first series E32 left the factory. It was produced in over 300.000 units until April 1994. \n\nThe 7-Series was developed with a driver-oriented cabin, while Mercedes-Benz tried to offer more for the rear passengers. This is one reason why the E32 was very popular in countries where a lot of executives used to drive their cars. In this segment, BMW won hands down. The technological improvements such as the ASC (Automatic Stability Control) that prevented the wheelspin and the central console tilted toward the driver won the customer's hearts. For the rear-seats owners, the 7-Series was offered with a long wheelbase that offered ample legroom.\n\nUnder the hood, there were various engine choices. While the V12 was famous for its performance, the 6-cylinder units were known for fuel-efficiency, especially when mated to the 5-speed manual."

    "model_description": "Following the path of the New Six concept launched in 1968 with the E3 bodywork, the first generation of the BMW 7-Series was unveiled in 1977.The first 7-Series started its climb on the ladder of success in 1977 with a lineup of vehicles that featured only six-cylinder engines. A prototype model featured a V12 engine, but it was just one of a kind. Its angled fascia resembled a shark nose profile.\n\nThe vehicle's look was modern and it was a complete step away from the previous design trend. The only design idea that was carried over was the four rounded headlights concept. Other than that, everything was new. The flat, wide slightly upward hood was accompanied by a simple greenhouse and a descending trunk lid. The chromed bumpers were a fashion for the cars on those times. In 1983, when the facelift occurred, the kidney grille was enlarged and new plastic-covered bumpers appeared.\n\nInside the vehicle, the 7-series featured numerous innovations such as the service-control lights, climate control, and the on-board computer. The base model with the basic trim featured cloth seats and manual gearbox, but more amenities were added for the upper trim levels including sunroof, power windows, leather seats, and power locks.\n\nThe engine line-up started with engines with four-barrel Solex carburetors, but soon all the engines received Bosch fuel injection systems. The most powerful engine was the 286 hp 754i, a model that featured an inline-six unit, aided by a turbocharger."

    "model_description": "Since the open-top vehicles are usually slower than their coupe siblings, most car enthusiasts prefer the latter for performance.Yet, the convertibles are somehow more attractive, and thus, there is a serious market for them, especially if they are fitted with high-power engines.\n\nThe M8 Competition Convertible received a facelifted version at the beginning of 2022, along with its hard-roof versions, the Coupe, and the Gran Coupe. Yes, it couldn't match them in terms of acceleration times or hard-cornering abilities, but it had more flavor with the top down while cruising on the streets.\n\nAlong with the facelifted version, it received minor exterior details. Apart from the color palette, which was enlarged, it kept the same appearance. The same bumper with black inserts and wide center grille in the lower apron dominated the front fascia, while the side scoops kept their hexagonal mesh pattern for the ducts that channeled the air to the front disc brakes. The light-alloy wheels, though, were changed with a standard 20\" set and a few options for other designs with the same size. Its M8 predecessor featured a set of 19\" as standard with an option for 20\" alloys.\n\nThe cockpit went through some changes and received a 12.3\" touch screen atop the center stack. It replaced the older, 10.25\" unit from the 2018 model and also got some upgrades for the infotainment system in terms of performance. The M8 Convertible featured standard sport seats with multiple adjustments, while the carmaker offered an option for Carbon bucket seats for those who still wanted to try the car's muscles on a track.\n\nUnder the hood, there were no surprises. It still had the same 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 that provided 600 PS (592 hp) for the M8 and 625 PS (616 hp) for the Competition version."

    "model_description": "Unveiled alongside the M8 Coupe, the first ever BMW M8 Convertible is powered by the same engine, which was borrowed straight from the fastest sedan in the BMW lineup, the M5.Just like in its coupe brother, the 4.4-liter, twin-turbocharged V8 develops 600 horsepower and 750 Nm of torque in the base model and 625 horsepower in the M8 Convertible Competition version, which are identical numbers with the M5 donor.\n\nAlso shared with the M8 Coupe and taken straight out of the M5 is the M xDrive all-wheel-drive system with a rear-based setup and Active M Differential, sending the power to either all four wheels or just the rear ones via a ZF-sourced eight-speed automatic gearbox. Ina  similar fashion to its brothers the M8 Convertible can be driven either in the default 4WD setting or 4WD Sport mode, which sends a lot more power to the rear wheels. When the DSC (Dynamic Stability Control) is deactivated, the model becomes a pure 2WD car. The standard M8 Convertible can go from 0 to 100 kph (62 mph) in 3.4 seconds, while the 200 kph (124 mph) speed is clocked in 11.3 seconds. The M8 Convertible Competition is slightly faster, with the 0-100 kph time taking 3.3 seconds and 200 kph being reached in 11.1 seconds."

    "model_description": "After a little over three years on the market, the seventh generation of the BMW 3 Series received an update, or LCI (Life Cycle Impulse), as the carmaker named it.The 3 Series was the most successful model in BMW's history, selling over 16 million of them between 1975 and 2021 in seven generations. Moreover, between October 2018, when the seventh generation was introduced at the Paris Motor Show, and May 2022, when the car received an LCI, it was sold in over 1 million units, making it the best selling generation compared to its predecessors. Still, the German carmaker decided to keep the sales figures up and refreshed the range.\n\nWith its refreshed front fascia, the 3 Series sedan looked even sportier thanks to the reshaped headlights and the enlarged \"kidney-grille\" at the front. Moreover, as an option, the carmaker added adaptive LED headlamps. Last but not least, the aggressive design could have been enhanced even more with the optional M Sport Package and M Sport Package Pro, the latter being available for the first time in the 3 Series.\n\nThe interior went through a significant upgrade with the introduction of the BMW Curved Display, which featured the 12.3\" instrument panel in front of the driver and the 14.9\" infotainment screen atop the center stack. Both panels were covered by the same piece of glass, creating a flowing sensation as a unique wide display. \n\nUnder the hood, BMW installed a wide choice of engines, ranging between 148 hp (150 PS) and 369 hp (374 PS), with either four or six cylinders fed by gasoline or diesel. Moreover, a plug-in hybrid version was also available. Depending on the engine version and options, the power went to the rear or in all corners via a manual or an automatic transmission."

    "model_description": "BMW has sold over 15 million 3 Series since introducing the nameplate back in 1975, meaning its the most successful model of the Bavarian carmaker.Codenamed G20, its seventh generation was unveiled in the flesh at the 2018 Paris Motor Show only in sedan guise, with other body variations to be launched in the future. The G20 is a lot larger than its F30 predecessor in almost every way, making it about as big as 5 Series of the E39 variety.\n\nThe all-new 3 Series Sedan is therefore 76 mm longer (at 4,709 mm), 16 mm wider (1,827 mm), 1 mm taller (1,442 mm) and has a 41 mm longer wheelbase (2,851 mm). Thanks to wider front and rear tracks, the model not only features much improved interior volume but should also offer better agility. For the first time in its segment, the 3 Series G20 features optional Adaptive LED headlights with BMW's Laserlight technology, with the car also now coming with the recently introduced BMW Operating System 7.0. An assortment of turbocharged four and six cylinder engines are available at the start of sales, both diesel and gasoline."

    "model_description": "For 2016, BMW's most popular compact sedan got a refresh, building upon the well-known recipe: coupe shape with four doors for practicality, front-engine, rear-wheel drive and a happy driver in between.With the LCI version, the 2016 BMW 3 Series got new bumpers with revised air intakes and integrated Active Cruise Control (ACC) sensor (optional), standard LED taillamps, redesigned headlights with LED daytime running lights as well as optional full-LED headlights. The interior gains new materials, additional chrome accents, a redesigned central console and a huge list of options.\n\nMechanically, most of the engines are now sourced from the BMW EfficientDynamics modular engine family, coming with revised turbochargers, better fuel economy, and power delivery. The 6-speed manual gearbox can now blip the throttle on downshifts while the 8-speed automatic allows multiple sequential downshifts.\n\nA special breed is the new 330e, which is a plug-in hybrid version. Compared to other versions, this one has a 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline unit and an 88 hp electric motor. The pure electric autonomy is about 40 km (25 miles) and that is not bad at all. It comes standard with 8-speed automatic transmission. \n\nAnother cool feature is the 5 kW climate control unit that can heat or cool the vehicle while charging. Combined with a designated application on the user's mobile phone, it means that the vehicle can be programmed to be cooled or warmed in advance."

And the BMW 3 Series range is now also available in a trio of trim and equipment variants \u2013 the Sport Line, Luxury Line and Modern Line.

    "model_description": "BMW upgraded the 3-Series lineup in 2008 and made it ready for the Euro 5 norms that became mandatory starting with January 2009.After four years on the market and a successful career, the German carmaker had to improve its engine lineup. As usual, it couldn't refresh only the drivetrains, and it had to work on other areas as well.\n\nAt the front, the main difference was seen in the company's \"kidney\" grille design, which featured rounded interior edges instead of the clear-cut style used before. BMW also included the grille's chromed top rim in the front fascia, not on the hood as it was on the pre-facelifted version. The lower bumper area received a smiling cut instead of the straight one. Further modifications followed in the rear, where the new LED taillights featured smaller reversing lights.\n\nInside, the most visible change was for the automatic transmission selector. On the 2008 model, BMW adopted the joy-stick system used on the bigger brother 5-Series instead of the classic, linear style with a side gate for the manual mode. The optional iDrive system featured voice-controls and a set of buttons used for short-cuts to the menu.\n\nUnder the hood, the German carmaker offered a vast engine choice and started it with a 2.0-liter naturally aspirated gasoline unit that provided 136 hp, seven more than its predecessor. For turbo-diesel versions, BMW introduced a fuel-efficient 115 hp unit paired with a 6-speed manual. The all-wheel-drive versions were named as xDrive instead of xD or xI as before."

It wasn't an easy job to do, but the results exceeded the expectations.\n\nFrom the outside, there were minor changes to the bodywork. The distinctive new look of the headlights, with a double curved line on the bottom, matched the new bumper. In the back, a new set of taillights was installed. From the sides, there were little differences between the facelift and non-facelift versions.\n\nInside, a new steering wheel with paddle-shifters was installed for the vehicles equipped with the automated (SMG) transmission. Other than that, most of the base models remained the same, with minor changes to trims. The infotainment unit was upgraded.\n\nThe most important change was for the drivetrain, where a new engine lineup was introduced. The base model was a 1.8-liter unit, named 316i, which offered 115 hp. The most popular version was the 318i, which offered a 2.0-liter unit rated at 143 hp. It was the first 2.0-liter with four cylinders installed on a BMW since the first generation. Top of the range version was the 231 hp 3.0-liter unit, which could have been mated to a 6-speed manual, with rear or all-wheel-drive system. All versions were available with an automatic, 5-speed transmission."

    "model_description": "After three generations of the 3-Series, in 1998, BMW introduced the fourth generation.It wasn't the big visual leap between the second and the third generation, but it was an important technical evolution.\n\nThe design of the new generation E46 started in 1993 just three years after the previous generation was introduced to the market. In November 1997, BMW send the press release for their new vehicle and, in April 1998, it started the sales and deliveries.\n\nThe new design featured clear headlights cover over the lamps and a downward shaped turn-signal on the corners. The hood comprised the \u201cBMW-kidney\u201d grille design. To cool the engine, the bigger grilles were on the lower side of the bumper, under the foglights. The flared wheel-arches were no longer reserved for top-spec models, but for the entire range of the car.\n\nInside, the car featured all the important information for the driver. The instrument cluster featured the five standard dials in most of the 3-Series since the introduction of the E30: coolant temperature, speedometer, tachometer, fuel level and, on the lower part of the rev-counter, the instant fuel dial. The dashboard was no longer that much tilted toward the driver so the passenger could enjoy or adjust easier the audio controls.\n\nThe technical modifications of the E46 were important. It was the first 3-Series that offered engines with more than 100 hp even on the base engine. The E46 also marked the return of the all-wheel-drive system, which was used on the E30 but lost on the E36 generation. It also saw the introduction of a new, 2.0-liter turbodiesel engine. The car was available with 5- or 6-speed manual transmission and 4- and 5-speed automatic."

    "model_description": "It was hard to replace such a success story as the BMW 3-Series E30 that moved the company on top of the heights in the compact premium-car market.But it had to be done and, in 1991, the replacement was shown.\n\nWhen the second generation of the 3-Series was launched, the straight and simple lines were trendy. But that was more like the '70s design language and in the early '90s it was already considered as obsolete. New technologies were discovered and new trends followed.\n\nThe design looked like it was a scaled-down 5-Series. It was longer, wider and taller than its predecessor. With a front fascia covered by the headlights and the widened \u201cBMW kidney\u201d grille, the car was more aerodynamic than its predecessor. It featured a drag coefficient of 0.29, compared with the previous 3-Series that had a 0.33. The longer engine compartment allowed a much bigger space for the engines and a crumple zone. In 1993, the car received a mid-life cycle refresh that changed some of the engines and brought some others.\n\nInside, the legroom was better than the one offered by the E30. It now featured standard power steering and brakes for all the range. The interior featured optional amenities such as four power windows, air-conditioning or climate control, on-board computer, airbags for the driver and front passenger, sunroof, and a premium audio system.\n\nUnder the hood there was a wide range of engines starting with a 1.6-liter unit and up to a 3.2-liter for the M3. For the diesel versions, there was a 1.8-liter and a 2.5-liter unit, both turbocharged."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced a new generation of the 3 Series in 1982.It was an important step forward compared to its predecessor, especially since it also came in the highly-demanded four-door shape.\n\nThe first generation of the 3 Series was a blast to drive for those times. It was a sports coupe vehicle that charmed close to 1.4-million customers worldwide, and it could have been even more successful if it had a four-door version. However, that problem was fixed with the introduction of the 3 Series' second generation, the famous E30.\n\nOne of the most coveted features of the first-generation 3 Series was the quad-headlights design, and the carmaker decided to make it standard on the entire range. Its black grille with horizontal slats and the kidney grille that adorned the center of the front fascia were easy to recognize. It was an advanced design for its time, with body-colored bumpers adorned by black rubber strips to protect it from small scratches. The chromed trims around the windows were specific for the pre-facelifted model, which appeared in 1987. Even though it sported a four-door bodywork, the sedan shared the same wheelbase as its coupe sibling.\n\nInside, the dashboard featured a driver-oriented center stack, with the HVAC controls placed under the stereo. Worth mentioning that not all versions came fitted with an AC unit. Also, not all versions featured a tachometer. BMW installed bucket seats for the front passengers and a center console that subtly divided the driving area from the rest of the car. At the back, the carmaker placed a bench for three, although the one seated in the middle had to share their legroom with the transmission tunnel.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW placed a wide engine range, sending their power to the rear wheels via a manual or an automatic transmission."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced a facelifted version for the X4 just three years after introducing the second-generation's model.After successfully revolutionizing the automotive industry with the SAV-Coupe X6, BMW introduced a smaller brother named X4, which appeared in 2014. In 2018, the carmaker introduced a second-generation for it and then refreshed it in 2021. Thus, it matched the exact timetable with the other compact-sized SAV (Sport Activity Vehicle), the X3. Both vehicles shared the same CLAR (Cluster Architecture) platform with their bigger brother X5 and other sedans.\n\nBMW introduced a new front bumper design with a single section frame kidney-grille adorned by a mesh design. Its adaptive Matrix LED headlights were standard and flattered by 10 mm (0.4\") than on the non-facelifted version. On the sides, all versions came fitted as standard with specific side-sills, finished in light gray. At the back, the X4 featured LED taillights with a 3D design and horizontal lines to emphasize the car's width. The apron sported wide free-form tailpipe trims. \n\nInside, BMW installed a 10.25\" wide format infotainment screen above the center stack, with an option for a 12.3\" display, in the same free-floating look. All versions featured a three-zone automatic climate control for more comfort on the rear seats. The redesigned center console featured a new shape for the gear-selector and the iDrive's rotary knob.\n\nUnder the hood, the most significant upgrade was the electrification, which brought a new 48-volt system. All engines showed better fuel efficiency. Apart from vehicles fitted with internal combustion engines only, the carmaker also installed a plug-in hybrid drivetrain in the X4."

    "model_description": "The second generation of the BMW X4 was revealed in 2018 and brought a refreshed design, as well as new features.The front of the car looked very similar to the one of the previous X4, however, the small differences made it look even more aggressive and modern, like the bigger front grille with a 3D look.\n\nThe back of the car looked completely new, with its new taillights that were used on the BMW 8-Series and 3-Series being placed at the extreme edges.\n\nWhile the X4 had a high loading lid, once inside, the cargo area offered 525 liters. What\u2019s more, the rear seats were foldable and the space could increase considerably.\nOpening the trunk lid was easier by pressing the BMW Logo instead of the old fashioned way we were used with.\n\nThe practical sports coupe had improved driving dynamics, having a double wishbone setup, a widened rear track and a perfect 50-50 front to rear distribution.\n\nThe ride height was lowered, thus the X4 had a lower center of gravity. The car could easily take turns at high speeds with its astonishing degree of handling.\n\nUsers could choose between from the standard model of 190 hp to the top of the range, the 354 hp M40i.\n\nThe interior was made with great to touch materials, visually very modern with its virtual digital cockpit technology developed by BMW. The seats were very comfortable and offered great support.\nThe passengers in the back though should not be very tall, as the roof line is low. The middle seat could only accommodate a child if comfort was desired."

    "model_description": "The second Sport Activity Coupe in BMW\u2019s history was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show 2014 in its production form after being introduced as a concept around a year earlier.The new model featured styling cues that fitted perfectly within the BMW range at the moment, with the headlights connected to the kidney grilles, massive air intakes and a front bumper that subtly concealed the usual \u2018X\u2019 all SUV-like Bavarian cars do. On the engine front, all units were EU6 compliant and all of them were available with the automatic 8-speed gearbox, only one being offered with a manual, the entry-level xDrive20d model. For the first time on one of their models, the Germans decided to offer a balanced selection of both diesel and petrol engines, some countries getting only one choice, like the UK where only diesel models were initially put up for sale. Performances were impressive as the near 2-ton car, in its most powerful version, the xDrive35d, could do 62 mph in just 5.2 seconds. The X4 also was fitted with the latest onboard technology from BMW, as part of the ConnectedDrive system."

    "model_description": "Four years after introducing the third generation of the X3, BMW introduced a refreshed version for it, with upgrades in all the areas: exterior, interior, and drivetrain.The 2017 X3 shared the same CLAR (Cluster Architecture) platform with its bigger brother, the 2019 X5. Worth mentioning that the third X3 generation was already more extended than the first X5 generation. The X3 already matched its bigger brother's technologies with the facelifted version and offered a better choice for an all-around vehicle. Since it was shorter than the fourth-generation X5, it was easier to drive it in cities.\n\nFrom the outside, the X3 LCI (life-cycle impulse) featured a new front bumper with an enlarged kidney grille with a single section frame. Its standard LED headlights, with an option for Matrix LED, were 10 mm (0.4\") flatter. On the sides, all versions came fitted as standard with specific side-sills, finished in light gray. At the back, there was a new design for the taillights with horizontal turn signals. Depending on the version, the car featured new flush-fitting free-form exhausts.\n\nInside, BMW installed a 10.25\" wide format infotainment screen above the center stack, with an option for a 12.3\" display, in the same free-floating look. All versions featured a three-zone automatic climate control for more comfort on the rear seats. The redesigned center console featured a new shape for the gear-selector and the iDrive's rotary knob.\n\nUnder the hood, the most significant upgrade was the electrification, which brought a new 48-volt system. All engines showed better fuel efficiency. Apart from vehicles fitted with internal combustion engines only, the carmaker also offered an option for a plug-in hybrid."

    "model_description": "The BMW X3 reached its third generation already.It was the vehicle that started the SAV (Sport Activity Vehicle) lineup in BMW back in 2003. In 2017 evolved in both terms of design and technology. The platform, design, engines, and interior are new. The only part that was kept was the 8-speed automatic gearbox from ZF. But even that had received some software updates.\n\nOn the outside, a bigger grille appeared on the front and, in the bumper, there are other three openings for cooling the engines and brakes. In the center, hidden behind the mesh, is the radar for adaptive cruise control and AEBS that helps the driver to avoid crashes. The 2017 X3 is slightly bigger than the previous generation by 56 mm (2.2\u201d), which was added to the wheelbase that now has 2864 mm (112.8\u201d). That is good for the rear seat passengers.\n\nFor the driver, BMW installed a new semi-automated driving system that allows the vehicle to keep its lane, follow the car in front at a safe distance and brake if necessary and even take turns. Since the autonomous driving was not regulated, the driver still has to keep a hand on the wheel. At least from time to time when the car asks for.\n\nThe base engine is a new, 2.0-liter gasoline unit that offers 181 hp, while the top version is the X3 M Competition that punches 503 hp! Two turbodiesel engines are offered and also a 293 hp plug-in hybrid version."

    "model_description": "The second generation of the BMW X3 has received a facelift in 2014.As usual for the German brand, the refreshed version brought more grunt under the hood and a revised look. \n\nBack in 2003, BMW launched the first generation of the X3. The brand's officials didn't name the car as an SUV, but as SAV \u2013 Sports Activity Vehicle. The idea behind the name was that the car was sportier than other SUVs from its segment. It was an SUV built for the road, but with decent off-road abilities. \n\nThe redesigned, 2014 X3 was longer by 1 cm (0.4\u201d) by the new design for the bumpers. The front fascia featured new headlights, which were offered as an option with LED. The foglights were also available with the LED technology as an option. The rearview mirrors were redesigned and incorporated the LED turn-signals.\n\nInside the vehicle, new materials and new colors were available. The big trunk could take 550 liters (19.4 cu-ft) that could have been extended up to 1600 liters (56.5 cu-ft). The tailgate featured an optional hands-free open/close system by swiping the foot under the bumper. \n\nThe X3 was available as rear-wheel-drive or all-wheel-drive. The former was used only for specific engines, while the latter was the most common option and it was standard for most of the engines/transmission configurations. A newly developed 2.0-liter turbodiesel with twin-turbo was available and it offered 190 hp. The standard transmission for most of the models was a 6-speed manual, while an 8-speed automatic was offered as an option or standard for specific engines."

    "model_description": "The first compact crossover from a luxury sedan brand, the BMW X3 was revealed for the first time in 2003.The second generation BMW X3 was released in 2010 at the Paris Auto Show. Larger than its predecessor, the new X3 was similar to the X4 in terms of exterior design.\n\nThe main target of the new model was to increase comfort and space. While the first generation had a somewhat cramped interior and offered a rough ride, the then-new X3 improved these aspects. \n\nWhile the suspension was redesigned to improve the ride quality, the X3 still remained solid, with a very responsive handling.\n\nEven with a taller center of gravity, the X3 still handled like a 3-Series on the track.\n\nInside, the fit and finish was highly improved, giving an athletic feel. \n\nTwo trim levels were available with the second generation: the xDrive 28i and the xDrive 35i.\n\nStandard features included 17-inch alloys, automatic headlights, fog lights, rain-sensing windshield wipers, leatherette upholstery, automatic climate control, cruise control, Bluetooth connectivity, the new BMW iDrive interface and a 12-speaker sound system.\n\nWith the xDrive 35i, the X3 came equipped with 18-inch alloys and adaptive xenon headlights.\n\nMany options bundled into packages were offered, such as the Sporty Activity package that added sport front seats, roof rails and a sport transmission with paddle shifters, the Premium package with a sunroof and leather upholstery, the Dynamic Handling that added adaptive suspension dampers, and three driver selectable drive modes, as well as a Cold Weather package with heated front seats and a heated steering wheel.\n\nOther stand-alone options were also offered, such as bigger 19-inch alloys, a rear-view camera, a head-up display, a power liftgate and a premium sound system."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced the BMW X3 in 2003 and, in October 2006, it launched the mid-life cycle refresh that changed more parts in and out of the vehicle.BMW launched the 5-Series based X5 in 1999 and, four years later, the X3. It named its vehicles as Sports Activity Vehicle, or SAV for short, since it considered that those cars will be used mostly on paved roads and only rarely on soft off-road situations. They were absolutely right about that, but most of the X3s and X5s were built with all-wheel-drive.\n\nThe 2006 X3 LCI (Life Cycle Impuls) received new headlights that, along with the foglights, formed a \u201csix-eye\u201d look for the car. The front bumper was redesigned with distinctive separation for the upper and lower part. The same principle was applied in the back with the rear bumper. New taillights design was also introduced.\n\nInside, there was a new, three-spoke, steering-wheel and galvanized metal for the door handles. The improvements in the interior material quality were made also for the upholstery.\n\nUsually, when BMW does an LCI, the biggest improvements are under the hood. For the 2006 X3, the car-maker dropped some engines and improved or completely changed others. For the suspension, the standard model already featured a stiff setting for the dampers, but for those who want to trade comfort for handling, a sport-package was available."

    "model_description": "After the successful introduction of the BMW X5 on the market, the German carmaker didn't wait for too much to launch a smaller version and the first generation of the BMW X3 appeared in 2003.In the fall of 2003, at the Frankfurt Auto Show, BMW unveiled the smaller brother of the X5. It was a car that didn't have too many competitors on the market, except for the Land Rover Freelander, which was developed under the BMW management. With a platform taken from the BMW 3-Series, the X3 had the same rear suspension with the compact sedan. \n\nThe design was arguably one of its strongest elements and the car was blamed to look like a station-wagon on stilts. The unusual headlights design was changed on the mid-life cycle refresh in 2007. \n\nInside, there was room for five adults, with enough headroom and decent legroom for the rear passengers. In the dashboard, there was an option for the iDrive infotainment system, controlled via a rotary knob on the center console. There were more options for the infotainment unit, including a BMW AM/FM/M-CD Radio with eight speakers. A large panoramic sunroof was on the options list. \n\nThe traction system was jointly developed with Magna Steyr from Austria, where the SUV was built. All X3 models feature BMW's all-wheel-drive system, with a default 40:60 torque split between the front and rear axles and the ability to direct all torque to either axle. The system used an electronically controlled multiple-plate clutch to enable infinitely adjustable, fully variable distribution of torque from front to rear with the capability of up to 100 percent of engine torque going to either axle. The engine options were of 2.0- and 3.0-liters, with four and six cylinders, respectively."

    "model_description": "BMW unveiled the 2022 2 Series Coupe at the 2021 Goodwood Festival of Speed and, even though the hatchback sibling was front-wheel-drive, the two-door version kept the traditional rear-wheel-drive system.When the German carmaker decided to change the names for its cars, it kept the even numbers for the coupes and the odd ones for the regular four or five doors versions. That's why the 1 Series Coupe became a 2 Series, and it was a relief for BMW fans when the compact vehicle appeared with an RWD or an AWD system.\n\nThe car's exterior showed a different front fascia than its bigger brother, the 4 Series. It didn't sport the tall and narrow \"kidney-grille\" but a flat and broad one. Its slim, LED headlights with an underlining daytime running light showed an aggressive look, and the wide grille on the lower side of the bumper complemented it. The enlarged front and rear fenders made room for wider tires of up to 255/35 R 19 on the rear and 225/40 R19 at the front, depending on the options.\n\nInside, BMW packed all the 2021 technology, including the Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity. An 8.8\" touch-screen infotainment display was offered as standard, while a 10.25\" was on the options list. A 12.3\" digital panel found its place in the instrument cluster and could show the usual information about the car and the navigation map or the music played on the sound system. Like its predecessor, the 2 Series Coupe featured two bucket seats at the front and a bench for two in the rear, with limited legroom and headroom but still suitable enough for short trips. The trunk offered up to 390 liters (13.8 cu-ft) of space.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW installed a choice of gasoline and turbo-diesel engines. It provided two inline-four engines: one gasoline and a turbo-diesel, plus a turbocharged inline-six."

A larger kidney grille gives the front end of the new models a wider look and allows it to project a sportier impression. The outer air intakes in the three-section front end are now larger and emphasise the cars\u2019 powerful stance on the road. The rear end likewise cuts a muscular figure, the single-piece rear lights (LEDs as standard) with hallmark BMW L-shape extending well into the flanks. The interior of the new BMW 2 Series models features an all-new design for the instrument panel, which emphasises the focus on the driver even more clearly and significantly enhances the cockpit\u2019s quality feel once again. The interior now has a more spacious, calmer and clearer feel. The elegant design is accentuated by a host of details, such as contrast stitching and high-gloss black surfacing for the center stack and the chrome elements for the control panels in the doors."

Most materials used throughout the cabin were soft to touch and the sporty-elegant design gave a pleasant feeling.\n\nThe cabin was fitted with multiple storage spaces, including cupholders, central storage and well-designed door bins. In the rear cabin, the passenger space was better than in other coupes in the class and they benefited of a central armrest, as well as cupholders.\n\nPretty well equipped in the standard package, the 2 Series offered automatic climate control, USB connectivity, Bluetooth connectivity, a multi-function steering wheel and rain-sensing wipers. Other optional features included leather upholstery, parking sensors, large alloy wheels and others.\n\nWith different driving modes and a great suspension, the coupe felt sporty and glued to the road, driving it becoming real fun.\n\nFor those customers looking for the thrill, the powerful M235i was the best choice, reaching 100 km/h in 4.8 seconds, mated with a 8-speed automatic transmission. All engines available could be mated with a 6-speed manual transmission at no cost, but the automatic gearbox was standard."

    "model_description": "BMW released the 4 Series Gran Coupe in mid-2021, just a couple of days after it refreshed stablemates X3 and X4.When the German carmaker decided to split the 3 Series into two distinct models, the customers didn't seem too happy. At first, the difference between the two twin brothers was just the door numbers. Even the former 3 Series Gran Coupe became a 4 Series Gran Coupe, but without too many changes. But that changed starting with the G26 generation.\n\nOne of the most controversial parts of the 4 Series was the front fascia, which featured an oversized and tall kidney-grille with chromed surroundings and a 3D mesh pattern, but it resembled the former BMW 327 from 1937 and 1952 501. Its LED headlights looked mean and aggressive. Like its predecessor, the 2021 4 Series GC featured frameless windows for all the doors. Thus, it stayed in the four-door coupe league, with a sloped-down, fastback-like tailgate. The streamlined taillights create the illusion of a more comprehensive vehicle at the back, thanks to their horizontal LED lines.\n\nInside, the upgrade in the technical department was significant. The base models featured an 8.8\" screen above the center stack for the iDrive infotainment system and a 5.1\" color display in the instrument cluster. At the front, the high-bolstered front bucket seats provided enough side support for their occupants during high-speed cornering maneuvers. In the back, there was a bench for three adults. Even though the transmission tunnel was present, it wasn't that tall anymore and narrower. Thus, the rear middle passenger could place his or her feet under the left and right front seats. The 60/40 rear bench' seatback increased the trunk space from 470 liters (16.6 cu-ft) up to 1,290 liters (45.5 cu-ft).\n\nUnder the hood, the carmaker provided an engine range fit for a sporty four-door coupe. The base version featured a four-banger, turbocharged gasoline unit, while the top of the range M 440i received a 3.0-liter inline-six turbocharged powerplant."

    "model_description": "After BMW decided to name its coupe vehicles with even numbers, the former 3-Series GC became a 4-Series Gran Coupe, which the German carmaker introduced in 2014.Regardless of the body shape or the doors numbers, the 2018 BMW 4-Series Gran Coupe was based on the same platform as the regular, 3-Series Sedan. It was the answer for the Audi A5 Sportback and tried to convince customers that a five-door hatchback is as good as a two-door coupe.\n\nAfter Mercedes-Benz started the four-door-coupe trend with the CLS, other carmakers tried to make similar offers. BMW made the 4-Series GC but forgot a few things. It didn't hide the rear doors' handles, and the hunchback-shaped greenhouse was not the best solution they could get. On the plus side, the car featured frameless windows. Its overall, cab-rearward design resembled a coupe shape, but not at its best.\n\nInside, BMW managed to provide an authentic coupe experience for those seated at the front. The low-mounted seats, combined with a high center console, offered a similar 4-Series coupe driving position. Compared to the non-facelifted version, introduced in 2014, the 2018 model-year featured a digital display that replaced the older analog-dial system. The dash panel received a piano-black finishing.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW installed a range of five turbocharged engines, either gasoline or diesel. The carmaker paired them with either a six-speed manual or an eight-speed automatic, with rear- or all-wheel-drive."

    "model_description": "Following the introduction of the BMW 4 Series at the 2013 Frankfurt Motor Show, the Gran Coupe version was launched in the spring of 2014, at the Geneva Motor Show.BMW featured two different lines of cars in the same segment. Both, the 3 Series GT and the 4 Series Gran Coupe featured a 5-door hatchback bodywork, with the main difference being that the 4 Series had a sleeker, sportier look. BMW said that those two will not step on each other's shoes.\n\nThe 4 Series Gran Coupe featured the exact length of the regular, 2-door 4 Series, but it was taller by 12 mm (0.47\u201d), offering more headroom for the rear passengers. The frame-less doors inspired the same feeling like a regular coupe. In the front, the car kept the same look as the 2-door version. The car maker tried to offer a 4-door coupe, such as the 6-Series Gran Coupe but in a smaller (and more affordable) package.\n\nThe Gran Coupe was offered as a 4+1 seater. The middle passenger from the back-seat might not stay very well there, due to the transmission tunnel. The seatback from the rear bench was split in a 40:20:40 way, increasing the trunk space up to 1300 liters (45.9 cu-ft). The liftgate featured as standard an automatic opening and closing system, with a hands-free opening system offered as an option. Inside the cabin, there was the same technological equipment as in the 4 Series, with an infotainment system installed on top of the center stack.\n\nFor the drivetrain, the 4 Series Gran Coupe featured the same lineup as the 2-door version, with diesel and gasoline engines ranged between 143 hp and 313 hp. Most of the versions were available with all-wheel-drive."

    "model_description": "The small-segment minivan, BMW 2 Series Active Tourer, offered a roomier interior for families while keeping the manufacturer\u2019s premium feeling.With a front fascia that revealed a broad and tall grille, the 2 Series Active Tourer tried on convincing customers that it was a bigger car. Yet, its 4.4 m (173\u201d) length didn\u2019t confirm that. At least, viewed in the rearview mirror, it could impress a bit. Its raked windshield and long greenhouse related to the overall vehicle\u2019s length created somehow an SUV stance, or at least of a crossover. Viewed from its sides, it looked like someone took a 2 Series hatchback and pulled the roof upwards, lengthening the side pillars and the door panels. \n\nInside, the carmaker installed a dashboard with clean lines, in a minimalist design concept. BMW installed a digital instrument cluster instead of the older analog ones from its predecessor. It continued the display with an additional one that sat atop the center stack, with a touch-screen unit for the infotainment system. On the center console, extended under the dashboard, the carmaker placed a storage area with a wireless charger for mobile phones. The designers relocated the gearbox controls on the center armrest. Since the vehicle was designed for families, the carmaker created ample legroom for all five seats thanks to their raised mounting position. \n\nBMW selected a wide engine choice for the drivetrain, either gasoline, turbodiesel, or hybrid, with plug-in hybrid versions from 2022. The 2 Series Active Tourer was the first from its stables that came fitted as standard with a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox on the entire range. There was no manual option for it."

    "model_description": "The first generation of the 2-Series Active Tourer was introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in 2014.It was a shock for all the BMW fans: it was a front-wheel-drive vehicle.\n\nThe BMW always featured a rear or an all-wheel-drive traction system. To install a front-wheel-drive one in a BMW was something that its fans couldn't cope with. But the sales figures for the 2-Series Active Tourer were high. In 2018, the small BMW MPV received a facelift.\n\nDespite its compact size, the 2-Series Active Tourer offered enough room for five adults inside. Since it used the same platform as a Mini, with a transverse engine, the designers had more room for the cabin. With its raised greenhouse and the abrupt end, it looked like an inflated hatchback. The facelift brought a new front fascia, with a larger and taller grille design, and new headlights.\n\nInside, the center stack was tilted toward the driver, emphasizing its role. There were new materials used for the interior and a new BMW M-Performance package. The longer seat cushions made the vehicle more comfortable on long journeys. The customers could choose from different trim levels, including Luxury Line, Sport Line, and M Sport packages.\n\nFor the powertrain, the facelift received a wide choice of three- and four-cylinder units, plus a plug-in hybrid. The 2-Series Active Tourer was available with a choice of a manual or automatic transmission, including a new, 7-speed dual-clutch one."

    "model_description": "The 2 Series Active Tourer is the first front-wheel-drive car BMW ever made, sparking a lot of controversy in the automotive world.For the BMW fans, if someone told them that a front-wheel-drive MPV will actually be a car manufactured by BMW in 2014, they would\u2019ve probably said it is a joke.\nThe concept of a family car is very well developed in Germany, and maybe it was the perfect timing for BMW to produce a car that excellently combines an MPV with their already known skittish vehicles.\nOverall, it was not the usual MPV you would\u2019ve expected. Yes, it had 7 seats, and yes, the driving position was high, but would you expect a 231 hp on 2.0-liter petrol engine?\nWe guess not. But at the same time, for someone who appreciates the way a BMW rolls and needs more room, the BMW 2 Series sounds like a perfect match.\nWith an unusual design for the Bavarian company and practicality dictating the way it eventually turned out, the Active Tourer also brought forward a new generation of modular engines with displacements as small as 1.5-liters. The interior was done focusing on versatility and includes sliding back seats that are also foldable 40:20:40, plenty of storage spaces and the first refreshed center console in quite a few years. \nAt launch, all engines were compliant with the latest CO2 emissions in Europe (the EU6 standard) and came connected to either new 6-speed automatic or manual gearboxes or a more common 8-speed ZF auto unit. The official world debut took place at the Geneva Motor Show in 2014."

    "model_description": "While the 3 Series was reserved for the four-door sedan version, the Coupe was renamed as the 4-Series.It was the BMW strategy to enhance its lineup, and it worked.\n\nFor the 2020 model year, BMW introduced a completely new 4-series in June 2020. It was based on the 2019 concept-car showed in September 2019 at Frankfurt Motor Show, one of the last important motor shows before the pandemic started.\n\nThe 4-Series was a shocking appearance with its kidney-grille, which got bigger and covered the front fascia's middle side from the bottom of the apron to the hood. It was huge! On the sides of the front bumper, BMW installed a pair of vents to cool the brakes. BMW opted for standard LED units for the headlights, while the laser ones were on the options list. The sculptured door panels and the raked C-pillars resembled the silhouette of the BMW 8-Series. Dual exhaust was installed in the back, with a three-slats splitter in the middle.\n\nInside, the car was fitted with sport-bucket seats as standard. The instrument cluster featured a TFT color display, and, on the center stack, the infotainment system was installed. It featured connectivity via Apple CarPlay, and it could support Android phones. If the car was fitted with the automatic gearbox, it was fitted with a pair of paddle-shifters as well.\n\nBMW offered the 4 Series with a power output between 184 and 374 hp, with rear- or all-wheel-drive. All versions were paired with an 8-speed automatic gearbox. The diesel versions were fitted to a mild-hybrid system to achieve better fuel efficiency and to lower CO2 emissions."

Also, compared to the 3-series, the new coupe had a more agile handling due to the lower center of gravity and a wider track at the front and at the rear.\n\nThe 4-series was one of the widest coupes on the market at the time.\n\nHaving a big trunk and foldable rear seats, the 4-Series could easily carry luggages for a longer trim and even longer items.\n\nThe cabin was impeccably crafter with high quality materials and the sporty design matched the outside look.\n\nThe cabin was very roomy in the front, and we could not complain about the legroom and headroom available for the rear passengers, even if it was a coupe.\n\nThe 4-Series was available in three body shapes: coupe, convertible and a 4-door Gran Coupe.\n\nA variety of engines was available, with 3 gasoline and 3 diesel options. \n\nThe gasoline engines developed between 184 hp and 326 hp, while the Diesel engine ranged between 190 hp and 313 hp.\n\nThe BMW\u2019s xDriver technology was standard on the 4-series coupe and offered great handling an an impressive grip. \n\nThe 4-series was equipped with a driver selectable driving mode and included the Comfort, Eco Pro and Sport."

Over the years, it gained new body shapes such as the sedan, station-wagon, convertible, and even a shortened version, the 3-Series Compact. As the coupe-shaped vehicles evolved into 4-doors coupe or shooting-brakes, it was needed that a new coupe-class: the 4-Series.\n\nThe 4-Series was launched at the 2013 North American Auto Show in Detroit. Some cues resembled the 3-Series, but apart from its platform, it was a completely different car. The narrow and wide grille, the swept headlights, and raked A-pillars evoked more sportiness. It sits lower and wider than its sibling, with its broadest point over the rear wheel arches. The twin LED headlights (optional) were shaped with a signature lamp. A large air-intake in the front apron was complemented by additional vents to aerodynamically enhance the airflow.\n\nInside, the bucket seats were fitted as standard, with high bolstering. The dashboard, the center stack tilted toward the driver, and the center console were focused on the driver. A floating screen for the i-Drive system was mounted on top of the dash. In the rear seats, there was seating for two, with a folding backseat in a 40:20:40 way.\n\nThe 4-Series was offered in four different trim levels and each of them could be customized for individual equipment variants. For the drivetrain, the 4-Series coupe was offered with a wide choice of gasoline and diesel engines, with rear or all-wheel-drive. For some versions, it was fitted with a manual transmission while others were offered exclusively with an 8-speed automatic."

    "model_description": "The BMW 5 series reached its 7th generation, with the first one being revealed in 1972.The popular vehicle caught the eyes of the buyers due to its luxurious look, both the exterior and the interior design, along with the sportiness and comfort offered over the years, thus the Bavarian company managed to sell over 600,000 units of the 5 Series, both sedan and touring versions.\n\nThe 5-Series won several awards such as the Executive Car of the Year, Connected Car Award (winner) and others, proving that its success lasted for over 28 years and still counting.\n\nThe new 2020 model brought a refined look, with a bigger kidney grille in contrast with slimmer headlights. The car\u2019s proportions were not changed, however, it gained a few inches in length. A longer wheelbase version was also available, only for the Chinese market though.\n\nThe 5-Series was already known for its low coefficient drag, thus keeping the tradition, the new 2020 G30 had a Cd of 0.23 (sedan) and 0.26 for the touring, both achieved with great attention paid to the exterior lines and the air flap control system for the radiator.\n\nWhile the 5-series used to be the bigger version of the 3-series, the 2020 generation brought it closer to the 7-series, by offering pretty much the same optional features, as well as the standard ones.\n\nThe G30 could be ordered with the BMW Laserlight, a system that was introduced in 2019 only for the top-of-the-line 5-series modules. The system became available for all of the existing trim levels.\n\nThe 2020 release also brought the M Sport Package with a new design, including a new front apron, enlarged air intakes, kidney grille bars with aluminum matt faces an others."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced the seventh generation of the 5 Series in late 2016, while the deliveries started in February 2017.Based on the same platform as the brand's flagship model, the 7 Series (G11), the 5 Series gained several technological updates over its predecessor, the F10 lineup. Yet, the silhouette was quite similar, but other significant changes made it a desirable vehicle in the premium segment.\n\nAt first sight, the G30 looked more like an evolution than a revolution. The vehicle received standard LED headlights, with an option for Laser ones that were the most powerful in the business. From its profile, the elegant look was interrupted by the side vents placed behind the front wheel arches. Even though they were not functional, they added a sporty accent to the car. For the four-door sedan version, the carmaker used similar lines as on its predecessor but wider LED taillights.\n\nSince the wheelbase was just slightly enlarged when compared to its predecessor, the 5 Series F10, the seventh generation of this Bavarian nameplate, provided a similar interior space. Yet, for the Chinese market, the automaker added a long-wheelbase version. The dashboard on both vehicles was similar, with a floating-design style for the infotainment system screen that sat atop the center stack.\n\nUnder the hood, the carmaker offered a wide choice of diesel and gasoline engines ranging between 190 PS and 462 PS, with either rear- or all-wheel drive systems."

    "model_description": "Over a million units sold from the sixth generation of the BMW 5-Series since its launch in 2010.In 2013 the car received a Life-Cycle Impulse, to help sales.\n\nUp until the facelifted version of the sixth generation of the 5 Series, BMW has succeeded to sell more than 5.5 million units of its mid-size executive sedan since its first generation was launched in 1972. Its success was based on performance models and new technologies. The 2010 generation was the first to introduce a hybrid version, a turbocharged V8, and an 8-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe facelift version featured redesigns of the front and rear bumpers, with new air-intakes shapes on the lower side. The car was fitted as standard with Xenon headlights, and a pair of new LED taillights. The option for LED foglights and Adaptive LED headlights was also available. The side-mirrors received new turn-signals as well.\n\nInside, there was a new instrument cluster and a new infotainment unit. The navigation was fitted as standard. The iDrive's turning knob was available with a touch-sensitive surface so the driver could write on it for easier input of a new destination for the sat-nav system. The instrument cluster received a new 10.25\u201d TFT screen. Its colors and information were different depending on the selected driving programs such as Comfort, EcoPro or Sport modes.\n\nFor the engine compartment there was a new entry-level engine for the 518d model. It was a 2.0-liter turbodiesel unit that offered 143 hp."

    "model_description": "The BMW started manufacturing the 5 Series in 1972.The 5 Series was available in 4 body types: sedan, touring, Gran Tourismo and a 4-door sedan with a longer wheelbase that was only produced for China and the Middle East.\nThe 2010 BMW 5 Series was at its 6th generation and was unveiled by the German automaker on November 23 in Munich. The new generation 5 Series Sedan was developed on a new platform, dubbed F10 and boasts a larger wheelbase for improved stability and road handling.\n The design was thought so the new 5 Series can stand out, but at the same time preserve BMW's traditional design cues. The front fascia displays the typical kidney grille, while the hood received carefully applied aerodynamic creases that emphasize the car's muscular look. \nThe rear fascia exhibits an aesthetic approach derived from the new BMW 5 Gran Turismo, while the coupe-like roofline gives the new 5 Series Sedan a composed and well-proportioned look. \nBMW prepared one eight-cylinder and three six-cylinder petrol engines as well as two six-cylinder diesels along with a four-cylinder turbodiesel that develops 184 hp.\nThe F10 was also the first of the 5 Series to offer a hybrid drivetrain, a V8 turbocharged engine, a dual-clutch transmission for the M5, Integral Active Steering and a Parking Assistant.\nThe transmission options available were a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic ZF gearbox, excluding the M5 that was available with a 7-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual."

    "model_description": "In 2007, the BMW 5-series received a major update at its mid-life cycle.Besides some minor exterior changes, there were bigger surprises inside and under the hood.\n\nThe exterior didn't change too much. At the front, the headlights had received clear plastic covers, as well as the turn-signal indicators. The front kidney-grille is flush with the rest of the hood, to offer a refined look of the front fascia.\n\nInside, the 2007 5-Series offered a wide range of innovations in driver assistance. For instance, there is an available Head-up display, new Lane Departure Warning and Active Cruise control that featured a Stop&Go function. Another new option was the Nightvision. The system is based on a thermal imaging camera able to detect people, animals and objects, on and next to the road, up to a distance of almost 1,000 feet, transmitting a clear, high-contrast image to the Control Display.\n\nThe inline-six gasoline engine was used for more variants: the 528i, 530i and 535i either naturally aspirated or turbocharged. The top of the range 5-Series, apart from the M5, was the 550i that featured a 4.8-liter V8 unit. With its 360 hp, it was a strong competitor by any standards. In some markets, the standard transmission was a 6-speed manual but a 6-speed automatic with paddle shifters was offered at no extra cost. And that was something very rare in the automotive industry.\n\nSince the introduction of the all-wheel drive (Xdrive) for some BMW models, that system was demanded more and more. And it had its market share on the 5-Series."

    "model_description": "While it wasn't a masterpiece of design, the E60 BMW 5 Series was the first 5 series to have the iDrive, the last to have a naturally aspirated M5 version and the generation with the biggest engines in the 5 Series history.In 2003, the Flame-surfacing design theme created by Chris Bangle was the main theme for the BMW lineup. After the 7-Series, the 5-Series was touched by it, and the result was the E60.\n\nThe dragon-style headlights, the massive cabin, and tall profile were some of the features of the E60 BMW 5-Series. Curved surfaces were blending in to inspire movement and a fluid sculpture. But the overall design was not a pleasant surprise for the BMW fans around the world. \n\nThe controversial design was continued inside the cabin, with a center console that was not tilted toward the driver. On the center console, the rotary knob of the iDrive system was in place and changed the way the on-board computers looked for any BMW. A standard, 6.5\" display was installed. Also, standard-fit was Bluetooth connectivity. \n\nFor better performance and balance of the car, the front side featured aluminum parts. The final result was a claimed 50:50 weight distribution. \n\nThe 5th 5-Series started with a wide range of engines, gasoline, and diesel, with displacements ranging from 2.0-liter up to a 4.5-liter unit. Later on, in 2005, a 4.8-liter V8 and the mighty M5 with a 5.0-liter V10 were added. While most of the 5-Series were offered with rear-wheel-drive, some versions were offered with the xDrive all-wheel-drive system."

    "model_description": "The fourth generation of the BMW 5-series was unveiled in 2000 in Europe and in 2001 in the U.S. The car was so praised by all the media around the world, that it was hard to be improved.\n\nThe E39 5-Series was a successful sedan for the German car-maker. It was available with a wide engine choice, both gasoline, and diesel. It was available as a sedan or a station-wagon (named Sports Touring in the U.S. market). The M5 version was powered by a V8 engine and it stayed that way even after the facelift, or Life-Cycle Impulse (LCI) as BMW named the facelift.\n\nOn the outside, there was a slight improvement over its predecessor. The grille was a carryover from the M5, the clear-lens headlights were improved and a new lip was installed on the bottom of the front spoiler. The \u201cangel-eyes\u201d feature was enhanced, to clearly show rounded lightened circles inside the headlights. In the back, the taillights were revised and received LEDs.\n\nInside the car, there were minor changes to the dashboard and instrument cluster. A factory pre-wired for the telephone was available and, for higher trim-levels, a premium sound system was available. Richer equipment was fitted as standard for the 6-cylinders models, while the 4.4-liter V8 was standard-fit with a 5-speed automatic transmission on specific markets.\n\nMost of the engine range was adjusted to new standards and new performances. The 5-speed manual was standard for most of the range. The M5 still had the 6-speed manual and no automatic option."

    "model_description": "The fourth generation of the BMW 5-Series was introduced in 1995.It was designed from scratch, with a completely new concept in mind. And the result worth it.\n\nAfter three generations with twin-round headlights, the E39 broke the rules and came on the market with clear glass over the headlights. The car's designer was Joji Nagashima and the BMW director of the design was Christopher Bangle. The E39 had to prove it can be as successful as its predecessor, the third 5-Series E34.\n\nUnlike its predecessors, the E39 featured smooth and curved lines. It was the beginning of the biodesign era and all cars started to loose their angular shapes. The flowing surfaces and ascending lines of the 5-Series E39 were a revolution for its predecessors and ahead of its main rivals on the market.\n\nInside the car, there was room for five adults, even if the center rear seat was obstructed by a bulky transmission tunnel. The instrument cluster featured the standard BMW layout with two large dials, two small dials, and a gauge for instant fuel consumption. The air-conditioning and the audio system was offered for the entire range, but only the upper trim levels could have been equipped with high-end audio systems.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW 5-series was offered with engine starting with 4 cylinders and went up to a V8 unit. It was equipped with a 4-cylinder turbocharged diesel unit as well. Depending on the engine, it was offered with 5- or 6-speed manual transmission or with a 4- or 5-speed automatic. It wasn't offered with all-wheel-drive."

    "model_description": "The third generation of the 5-Series was introduced by BMW in November 1987 it's mid-size sedan contender in the premium segment.In the mid-'80s, the battle for the premium mid-size segment was mainly between the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and the BMW 5-Series. By the time when the third generation of the 5-Series was introduced, the two car-makers already took their paths, with BMW going for sportier models and the Mercedes-Benz for more comfortable cars.\n\nThe third generation of 5-Series kept the four-round headlights on the front, with a wide and narrow grille. The BMW \u201ckidneys\u201d were more exposed, with silver or body-colored rim. The plastic bumpers were already a fashion and the older, chromed ones, were part of the history. Still, a black rubber strip was kept.\n\nThe dashboard was tilted toward the driver and it offered the controls for HVAC and audio system, plus a pair of vents. The instrument cluster was typical, with the speedometer, tachometer, fuel level, and coolant temperature, plus an additional \u201ceconomy\u201d dial which showed the instant fuel consumption with a dial.\n\nUnder the hood, the 1988 5-Series was offered with a choice of gasoline and diesel engines. It was the first 5-Series available with all-wheel-drive for the 2.5-liter gasoline unit. The standard transmission for most of the engine range was a 5-speed manual, while the 540i was offered with a 6-speed unit. A 4- or 5-speed automatic was offered on selected models. The 5-Series was the first BMW to offer Electronic Damper Control and the introduction of Automatic Stability Control + Traction (ASC+T or ESP)."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced the second generation of the 5-Series in 1981, and while the exterior didn't show impressive changes, the engineering department burned the midnight oil.With a healthy market and an increased demand for premium vehicles, BMW considered growing its market share. But didn't want to do that by lowering the prices. It did it by improving its cars to higher levels and delivered true sport sedans for its customers.\n\nWhile it still kept the raked forward front fascia, the 1981 5-Series resembled the front fascia of its already known little brother, the 3-Series. BMW connected the quad-headlamps design and chromed \"kidneys\" through plastic horizontal slats. Its bumper was no longer a metallic part but a wrapped-around plastic one with chromed strips, a rubber area, and the turn signals. As an option, the carmaker offered additional fog lights. For the North American market, BMW was forced by U.S. regulations to increase the bumper size, which spoiled the car's overall look.\n\nInside, there was a new design concept already imagined on the first 3-Series. The dashboard was centered around the driver, and the tilted center stack was straightforward to reach. Its taller center console also made a clear distinction between the \"operation center\" and the rest of the vehicle.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW installed a wide engine choice ranged between 90 hp and 218 hp. Also, in 1983, BMW presented the fastest diesel-powered vehicle in the world, the 524 td. It was able to reach up to 180 kph (112 mph), and it did that due to a turbocharged, inline-six unit. Apart from the regular models, the German carmaker introduced the M5 version in 1985 as a high-performance sports sedan."

    "model_description": "The first generation of the BMW 5-Series was launched in 1972.It represented the natural evolution of the \u201cNeue Classe\u201d introduced by the German car-maker in 1961.\n\nThe design of the 5-Series was signed by Paul Braq, following the line cues given by Michelotti and Hoffmeister, the designers of the BMW 1500 \u201cNew class sedan\u201d. The bold new design was previewed in 1970 in the BMW 2002ti Garmisch concept-car.\n\nOne year before the launch, the German motoring press spied a mule version of the 5-Series and claimed that it resembled the Fiat 132 model. A year later, the series model proved that the car was much different than the Italian car. The twin-round headlights and the chromed elements on the bodywork were stylish. The sloped trunk line completed the aerodynamic look of the car.\n\nInside, the 5-Series offered a spacious interior, with enough room for five adult passengers according to those times standards. The first models were fitted with only a few comfort features. Some models were available with a 3-speed automatic transmission and power windows were installed later on the model.\n\nUnder the hood, the initial models were offered with an inline-four engine. Later on, the engine lineup was completed with inline-six engines, with carburetors or mechanical injection. The most potent version was the M535i that was introduced in 1980 with a 5-speed manual gearbox and a limited-slip differential."

The car\u2019s proportions were not changed, however, it gained a few inches in length. A longer wheelbase version was also available, only for the Chinese market though.\n\nThe 5-Series was already known for its low coefficient drag, thus keeping the tradition, the new 2020 G30 had a Cd of 0.23 (sedan) and 0.26 for the touring, both achieved with great attention paid to the exterior lines and the air flap control system for the radiator.\n\nWhile the 5-series used to be the bigger version of the 3-series, the 2020 generation brought it closer to the 7-series, by offering pretty much the same optional features, as well as the standard ones.\n\nAvailable with the most wagons, the buyers could open the rear windscreen while leaving the trunk closed, a feature that eased the handling of light items.\n\nThe G30 could be ordered with the BMW Laserlight, a system that was introduced in 2019 only for the top-of-the-line 5-series modules. The system became available for all of the existing trim levels.\n\nThe 2020 release also brought the M Sport Package with a new design, including a new front apron, enlarged air intakes, kidney grille bars with aluminum matt faces and others."

    "model_description": "The BMW 5 series station wagon version was introduced in 2010, at the Leipzig Auto Show.In 2013, the station wagon, named Touring in the BMW range, received a facelift, along with the entire 5-series.\n\nThe 5-Series Touring was the version for those who require a bigger load capacity. With the rear seats up, it offered 560 liters (19.7 cu-ft) of space. The rear backseat could fold down in a 40:20:40 split system. With all the seats down, the flat platform allowed a large, 1670 liters (58.9 cu-ft) trunk space. To fold the rear seats, a pair of levers were on the sides, in the trunk compartment.\n\nThere were two interesting features for the tailgate. The rear window within the tailgate could have been open independently. When opened, the trunk fabric cover was automatically retracted. This feature was good if only a small item was placed inside. The load compartment cover was automatically lowered when the window or the tailgate was closed.\n\nTo open the trunk, there were few options: a button on the car-remote access key, a button near the driver, a kick under the rear bumper or, classically, via a small button on the tailgate. The \u201chands-free\u201d open system was available as an option.\n\nThere were two buttons on the tailgate's margin, which could be used to automatically close the trunk. One was just closing while the other also locked the car. As a safety measure, the car couldn't be locked if the remote-control key was inside the cabin."

    "model_description": "The sixth generation of the BMW 5 Series was introduced in 2009 and the station-wagon for it was introduced in the following year.The 2010 5-Series Touring was the fourth generation of the station-wagon for the mid-size German car, since the first two generations didn't have that in the offer. It appeared only from the third generation and it started with some improvements that made it different from its main rivals, the E-Class T-Model from Mercedes-Benz and from the Audi A6 Avant.\n\nThe car looked the same as the sedan up to the B-pillars and changed from there on to the back. It featured a longer roof and a raked tailgate. That cut a part of the trunk space, but BMW was not concerned about it. It stated that the idea was to create a sport-looking wagon, and it succeeded. The rear had a twin open system. Like its predecessors, it could be opened with the whole tailgate or only the windscreen. The parcel shelf in the back was automatically lifted in both situations to allow placing or removing items from the back.\n\nInside, the front side featured the same amenities as the sedan version. In the back, the 40:20:40 split rear bench backseat allowed a bigger trunk space than the sedan, but less than into an Audi A6 or in a Mercedes-Benz E-Class T-Model. With the seats folded, it formed a completely flat surface area.\n\nFor the engine compartment, the Touring version of the 5-Series was offered with a choice of diesel and gasoline units. For base models, the 6-speed manual transmission was fitted as standard, but for the more powerful versions, 8-speed automatic transmission was available. For selected versions, BMW offered an all-wheel-drive traction system."

    "model_description": "The fifth generation of the 5-Series Touring went through a facelift along with its sedan siblings in 2007.Despite the world economic crisis, it managed to survive until 2010, when it was replaced.\n\nThe facelift was scheduled before the first signs of an economic crisis appeared. With the \u201cshow must go on\u201d attitude, the German car-maker upgraded all the 5-Series lineup and moved on. New emission regulations were due to appear in Europe, so some parts needed to be improved while some others had to be changed.\n\nFrom the outside, the headlights came with new clear glass technology, transparent glass panels covering the direction indicators, and chrome surrounds. The kidney-grille was now flash to the air-dam. A new side-sill was installed, amplifying the car's length. Like the headlights at the front, the rear lights also came in a new, sophisticated clear-glass look and featured LED turn signals.\n\n\nInside, the 2007 5-Series was enhanced with new materials, with pleasant rubber finish on the controls for smooth and easy handling. The door panels featured a twin-tone finish: black trim bars at the top and the lower panel section. Some new additional storage options gave the 2007 5-Series an enhanced practical function. The split rear seatback was kept to increase the load area. New safety features were installed with adaptive cruise control and automatic braking.\n\nFor the engine-compartment, the 2007 5-Series Touring featured an improved range, and, apart from the M5 version, the top-of-the-line version was the 550i with 360 hp."

    "model_description": "The 2004 BMW 5 Series station-wagon, or Touring as it was named by the car manufacturer, was the third generation for that body type.The first two generations of the 5-Series had only the four-door sedan version.\n\nIt was designed during the Chris Bangle era, even though he wasn't the actual designer of the vehicle. He was just in charge of the final look. It was a large car with big engines. It even had an M5 model, with the mighty V10 unit that offered 500 hp. \n\nThe look was in the \u201cflame surfacing\u201d theme imagined by Chris Bangle. But it had a controversial design, especially on the headlights, which were completely unusual for a BMW, with extended wing-like corners on the front fenders. Some called them \u201cDragon-style\u201d, while others just said that those were \u201cAngel wings\u201d. In the rear, there was sloped tailgate. That had an interesting feature: the rear window could have been open without the entire tailgate. \n\nInside the vehicle, there was enough room for up to five adults and 500 liters (17.7 cu-ft) of trunk space that could have been increased up to 1650 liters (58.3 cu-ft), with the rear seats folded. \n\nFor the engine and transmission versions, there was something for everyone. Apart from the special M5 Touring version, it offered a power range between 160 hp and 361 hp, both gasoline and diesel. The standard transmission was a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic, depending on the engine."

    "model_description": "In 1997, the awaited station wagon for the BMW 5 Series E39 was launched.It was longer than the sedan version, but not by much. Just enough to make a good looking wagon. It was an instant hit for the premium station wagon market all over Europe and in the U.S. The 2000 kg (4400 lbs) towing ability and a big trunk transformed it into a favorite for the families. \n\nStandard features included air conditioning, four power windows, traction control, on-board computer, ABS, airbags and an adjustable steering wheel. \n\nThe 4805 mm (15.8 ft) long car could accommodate five people and 410 liters (23 cu-ft) of luggage in the trunk with the rear seats up. \n\nThe gasoline engines offered started with an inline 6 unit with a 2.0-liter displacement and went up to a 4.4 liter V8 with outputs ranging between 150 hp and 286 hp, respectively. Another lineup of turbodiesel engines was prepared for Europe, with a displacement of 2.0-liter and 3.0-liter. Transmissions offered were either a 5 or 6-speed manual, depending on the engine, and a 5-speed automatic as an option for most of the versions, but it was standard on the 540i with the 4.4-liter and 286 hp engine. \n\nUnlike the sedan sibling, the top performer 400 hp M5 was not available for the station-wagon."

    "model_description": "After five years of the third generation of the 5-Series, BMW introduced the station wagon version for its mid-size sedan.It was hard to take the decision, but it was a successful one.\n\nIn the mid-'80s, the only premium station-wagon for the mid-size segment was the Mercedes-Benz E-Class. The general idea was that the premium segment customers don't buy station-wagons. But the segment started to pick-up and BMW management decided to take a piece of the market.\n\nThe third generation of 5-Series was launched in 1987 but it wasn't until 1994 when they launched the station-wagon. It looks like the design team waited to see how the three-box model will be received by the market and only after that they started to work on the project. The cars were identical up to the B-pillar. Even the lower part of the rear doors was the same. But what happened above the beltline was a different story. The longer roof and the bigger trunk added practicality. The German car-manufacturer already had some experience with that type of bodywork from the smaller BMW 3-Series Touring. The individual opening of the rear window feature was added to the 5-Series as well. \n\nInside the vehicle, there was the same interior as in the sedan version, but the rear seats were folding type in a 60:40 split.\n\nFor the engine compartment, the four-cylinder units were deleted from the option list and only inline-six and V8s were installed. It also had the all-wheel-drive system on the 525iX (2.5-liter engine)."

    "model_description": "Changing from soft-top to hard-top just a few years ago seemed to be a good idea, but in 2020 BMW did the exact opposite by switching from hard-top to soft-top for the 4-Series convertible.BMW had a long history with open-top vehicles, even before WWII. The German car-maker always mastered the mix between the driving pleasure in a sports car and the open-top experience with minimal or no compromise in performances.\n\nThe first element that stood apart on the car's image was the grille. It was massive and extended down into the apron, eliminating the other grille from the bumper. The side-pods hosted the fog lights and fake air-intakes for the brake discs. The LED headlights were fitted as standard while the laser lights were on the options list. The 4-Series convertible featured a clean look, with curved surfaces, unaltered by sculptured doors from the sides. The designers installed a pair of fake vents behind the rear wheels and a couple of exhaust tips in the back.\n\nThe interior was suitable for four adults due to the big, 2.85m (112.2\") wheelbase. Since the soft-top took less room than the hard-top, the rear bench could have been moved almost over the rear axle. Due to the new system, the trunk offered 80 liters (2.82 cu-ft) more room than its predecessor. But that was not all. The soft-top could have been opened or closed at speeds of up to 50 kph (31 mph) in 18 seconds.\n\nThe 4-Series convertible was fitted with a choice of four engines ranged from 184 hp up to 374 hp with either rear- or all-wheel-drive. All versions were fitted with 8-speed automatic transmission. To comply better into the Euro 6d requirements, a mild-hybrid diesel version was added to the range."

    "model_description": "The fourth generation of the 6-Series Gran Turismo made a good impression in 2017 when it was introduced.In 2020 BMW announced the facelifted version for it.\n\nThe facelift came into the challenging 2020 year with the world pandemic situation when all the countries faced economic difficulties. The 6-Series GT was more the successor of the 5-Series GT rather than the lines of the 6-Series, but following the new naming system from the German car-maker, it had to bear an even number. It was a 5-door hatchback in coupe-style.\n\nBoth front- and rear-end shapes were refined to reflect the BMW design language. The clear geometry formed by a small number of lines provided a vivid showcase for the car's presence. The new kidney grille and headlights made a striking impression. The grille was wider and taller, maybe too big for the car's front area. The LED headlights with matrix function and non-dazzling high beam were fitted as standard while the laserlight for both beams was offered as an option. The front and rear aprons were re-shaped with narrower and taller side-intakes at the front and integrated exhausts in the back.\n\nInside, the 6-Series GT offered enough room for up to five passengers and 600 liters (21.1 cu-ft) of trunk space. It was more than the non-facelifted version. The driving post was surrounded by the center stack and the center console, with a tilted touch-screen display placed on top of the dashboard. The instrument cluster featured a complete digital display.\n\nBMW installed new Euro 6d engines under the 6-GT's hood. All versions were fitted with the 8-speed ZF automatic transmission. It was available with a rear or all-wheel-drive. Power ranged between 190 hp for the base, inline-four, engine and was raised up to 340 hp for the inline-six turbodiesel unit. All versions were fitted with a mild-hybrid system."

    "model_description": "The BMW 6 Series gained a new member in 2017 with the addition of the all-new 6 Series Gran Turismo which combines the long-distance comfort of a luxury sedan with the aesthetic appeal of a coupe as well as the advantages a hatchback offers.The front distinguishes through a new bumper with more squareish intakes and a slightly different headlight signature. The rear comes with new stoplights and hatch door. The low-slung silhouette of the new BMW 6-Series Gran Turismo also benefits its aerodynamic efficiency, which has been further improved with a host of other measures. Active air flap control brings additional louvres for the BMW kidney grille, which only open when extra cooling is required. A cockpit tailored to the driver, the extremely generous, variable-use space for occupants and luggage, high-quality design and carefully selected and precisely worked materials provide all the ingredients for superlative driving pleasure, a relaxed travelling experience and unbeatable practicality within a luxurious ambience."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced the third body version of the M4 in late spring of 2021 with the addition of an open-top vehicle, completing the lineup.When the German carmaker decided to change the M3 nameplate from the coupe, its fans were upset. Yet, it didn't change its mind and produced the M4 as a coupe and Gran Coupe. While the former was already known on the market, the latter wast a four-door fastback fake coupe with a sloped rear liftgate.\n\nIn the new clothing, the topless M4 kept the same core values from the Coupe at the front, with the twin kidney-grilles and the aggressive-looking LED headlights. Its panel soft-top could have disappeared in 18 seconds, at speeds up to 50 kph (31 mph). The new retractable roof featured a new technology that made it lighter than a hard-top and better insulated than a three-layer fabric one. BMW installed a new trunk lid at the back, which was flatter than on the M4 Coupe.\n\nInside, there were more standard features for the four-seat convertible. Gone were the analog dials; hence the M4 convertible received a standard digital TFT instrument panel. BMW installed a 10.1\" infotainment display above the center vents. The carbon fiber and aluminum trims were also standard, along with the sport bucket seats. Behind the cabin, the carmaker managed to fit a 300 liters (10.6 cu-ft) trunk with the roof down and 385 liters (13.6 cu-ft) with the top up.\n\nThe drivetrain was similar to the one fitted on the M4 Coupe, with only one difference: it was all-wheel-drive without the possibility to disengage the front wheels, as in the hard-top version."

The BMW M4 Convertible shares the elegant lines of its open-top 4 Series siblings. Its design language allows it to skilfully blend a distinctive and graceful silhouette boasting finely balanced proportions when the roof is open with an exceptionally dynamic coupe line, shorn off B-pillars, with the hardtop closed. At the same time, the M4 Convertible's styling cues - including a signature power dome for the bonnet, eye-catching exterior mirrors in twinstalk style and flared front and rear wheel arches bulging over forged light alloy wheels with mixed tires in 18-inch (optional 19-inch) format - all identify it clearly as a member of the BMW M3/M4 model family. The convertible comes with aluminum and carbon fiber reinforced plastic body parts, improved engine cooling, Active M differential, electric power steering and M compound brakes to ensure a precise and dynamic handling."

That's how the M4 appeared on the list.\n\nThe 4-Series was a shocking appearance when it was introduced in June 2020. The kidney-grille got bigger and now covered the middle side of the front fascia from the bottom of the apron to the hood. It was ginormous! On the sides of the front bumper, BMW installed a pair of vents to cool the brakes. The sculptured door panels and the raked C-pillars resembled the silhouette of the BMW 8-Series. Four exhausts were placed under the rear apron.\n\nInside, the car was fitted with sport-bucket seats as standard. The instrument cluster featured a TFT color display and, on the center stack, the infotainment system was installed. It featured connectivity via Apple CarPlay and it could support Android phones. If the car was fitted with the automatic gearbox, it was fitted with a pair of paddle-shifters as well.\n\nUnder the hood, the M4 surprised its customers with the introduction of the all-wheel-drive system. It was the first M4 that sent its power to all four wheels. The standard gearbox was a six-speed manual. For that, the power went exclusively to the rear wheels. The xDrive version was available only in conjunction with the 8-speed automatic."

    "model_description": "Back in 1985, the BMW introduced the M3, a rather sports car that was successful in touring motorsport.Wondering what\u2019s the connection to the M4? Well, the M4 was a coupe M3. \n\nWhile the M4 was basically the same car as the M3, the difference was the shape of it. At the same time, the M4 brought some of the practicality of the 4 series. \n\nThe load capacity was more than enough for two big luggages, as well as the cabin being equipped with lots of storage spaces \u2013 not very big though. The reason why the storage space was limited was the carbon drive shaft that was located underneath the center.\n\nWhile almost as practical as the 4 series, the M4 had a more aggressive design, with a big open grille to let the air in, as well as air vents on the sides of the bumper. The back mirrors had the iconic aerodynamic design we already know, the big brake discs were ventilated and made of ceramic carbon fiber.\n\nActually, carbon fiber was used both on the exterior and the interior to lower the car\u2019s weight.\n\n\nThe back of the M4 added to the visual aggressiveness with the 4 exhaust pipes, as well as the rear spoiler integrated into the trunk lid.\n\n\nThe design might look a bit too friendly compared to what was under the hood. The 3.0-liter straight 6 developed 425 hp and rocketed the coupe to 100 kph in 4.1 seconds.\n\nDefinitely not a cheap car, its price started at $71.000. At the same time, I would say it was a decent price for what the M4 had to offer."

    "model_description": "BMW M relentlessly tried to make its cars quicker and faster than its competitors, and the CS versions were even wilder.When you lock a car-maniac into its room due to a world pandemic situation, all they had to do was think about how to make a car faster. Maybe exactly that happened to the BMW M engineers, who had to work from home in the infamous year 2020. Unlike the rest of us, who wore out the TV remote controller and made a new couch to look like it was older than the house itself, they prepared an outrageous vehicle: the M5 CS.\n\nForget about the heavy, regular M5 (which was already a fast car) and look at the front, yellow, daytime running lights. We would name them \u201cangel eyes\u201d like anyone else, but we are afraid not to be banned forever from Heaven. They looked from the dark side. The grille was not tall, like on the M4, but shorter and above the sculptured bumpers that sported a lower grille and two side-scoops (functional). A carbon-fiber splitter helped to reduce the ground effect at higher speeds. BMW M made the hood and other parts from carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP). Some elements were left unpainted. Why bother? They looked better that way. Through the standard, 20\u201d light-alloy-wheels, the car sported the red calipers.\n\nInside, the carmaker dropped the 5-seat option and installed four M Carbon sport-bucket seats. At the front, the integrated headrests sported illuminated M5 logos and displayed the outline of the Nurburgring race-track. Behind the steering wheel, the engineers installed two carbon-fiber paddle-shifters for the 8-speed automatic M Steptronic gearbox. Inside the instrument cluster, there was no dial or gauge: just a wide digital customizable display.\n\nUnder the hood, M engineers dropped the most powerful engine ever installed in a BMW. The 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 provided 635 hp, which were sent in all corners. Like its non-CS brother, it was able to send all the torque to the rear wheels for spectacular drifts."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced the sixth generation of the M5 in 2017, and it was the first M5 available with an all-wheel-drive system.It was available with the Competition package, and it was refreshed in 2020.\n\nBMW introduced the strongest letter in the alphabet, the M, in 1977 with the mighty supercar BMW M1. After the introduction of the M3 \u2013 E30 in the mid-'80s, the German car-maker started a new era in automotive trend. The horsepower battle began for family sedans with the first M5 and it never stopped.\n\nThe Competition package took the M5 design to a different level with black styling on the grille surrounding. The door-mirrors caps and the rear spoiler featured the same color. The rear LED taillights received a new design and the twin-tailpipes featured thinner walls, for a better sound.\n\nInside, the M5 featured a complete digital display for the instrument cluster, and for the infotainment system, the latter sat on top of the center stack. The gear-selector was placed on the center console, surrounded by glossy-black trims. Since the car was built for high-speed driving and hard cornering, the front bucket seats supported the occupants due to the high bolstering.\n\nThe M5 Competition package squeezed 25 hp more from the regular M5 engine. It unleashed the 625 hp to all four wheels via an 8-speed automatic transmission. The traction system's different settings allowed the driver to send all the power to the rear wheels and disengage the dynamic traction control for drifting. And, if the 250 kph (155 mph) speed was not enough, the M Driver package option raised the bar to 305 kph (189 mph)."

The audio system was a 16-speaker Harman Kardon.\n\nSafety wasn\u2019t left aside and BMW equipped with M5 with front and rear parking sensors, a lane departure warning system, blind-spot detection and front collision mitigation.\n\nTwo option packages were available, the Driving Assistance Plus and the Executive.

The M engineers have carried out significant revisions to the outgoing model\u2019s power unit. For example, newly developed turbochargers, ultra-efficient indirect charge air cooling and increased fuel injection pressure together help to raise output and, above all, torque. The suspension of the new BMW M5 is likewise designed to deliver both maximum traction for everyday use and supreme dynamic performance on the track. \n\nVisually, the M engineers have redesigned the broader front side panels and front bumper trim to include larger apertures for the air feeding the cooling systems and brakes. Also new is the rear diffuser. The exhaust system\u2019s quartet of tailpipes are a visual pointer to the power generated by the BMW M5 and also lay on a suitably sporting soundtrack for the job in hand, courtesy of their flap control system. The driver can use a button to adjust the engine sound as desired."

All the previous M5s had subtle changes compared to the rest of the 5 series models. That habit was maintained in the 2013 model. The only changes are made to the front where a larger bumper with three big air intakes and honeycomb mesh is present. The kidneys are rounded by a chromed rim and on the front side fenders, there is ventilation grille. The side sills are a little bit bigger than of the other models. \n\nIn the rear, a quad exhaust, bigger rear bumper and a small spoiler on the trunk lid will tell the others that they were just overtaken by an M5. But this kind of modification is noticeable only by a car enthusiast. \n\nThe interior features enough luxury items to be considered a limousine. The standard list is long and includes bolstered seats, power-adjustable steering column, backup and front-side cameras. The interior space is enough for five people. But the center driveshaft tunnel is tall enough so only two passengers can sit comfortably in the rear."

    "model_description": "BMW changed its strategy and ditched the naturally aspirated engines for the top-performance version of the 5 Series, the 2011 M5.While the E60 M5 was powered by a V10 engine, the 2011 F10 M5 switched to a smaller V8 but was more capable. But not only that, it was more powerful and comfortable on long roads thanks to its longer wheelbase and better suspension.\n\nThe sixth generation of the 5 Series came on the market in 2009, and it was a clear departure in terms of styling from its predecessor. Its smoother lines made it look more like a luxury car than a sporty sedan. But all those softened shapes were drastically changed on the M5 version. At the front, the bumper was lowered and featured three wide air intakes: one in the center for cooling the engine and two on the sides for the brakes. Moreover, the carmaker installed a pair of vents on the front fenders. At the back, the carmaker placed a quad-exhaust system.\n\nInside, the carmaker didn't forget that it was a luxurious vehicle built on top of a 7 Series platform. That helped it get enough room for four passengers, or even five if one could sit atop the transmission tunnel. Unlike the regular 5 Series, the M5 was fitted with a golf-club-shaped gear stick for the automatic transmission. Moreover, the M-badged steering wheel featured a pair of aluminum paddle shifters to help the driver manually change gears.\n\nBut the most important part of an M5 was under the hood. Here, a newly developed 4.4-liter V8 helped by a pair of turbochargers raised the power figures to 553 hp (560 PS) and sent them through a seven-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox in all corners. The 2011 M5 was the first of its kind to offer an all-wheel drive transmission."

    "model_description": "With a design that sparked many controversies, the fifth-5 Series from BMW shook the world when it was launched in 2003.Then, two years later, the top-performer M5 stormed the performance-sedan market with its F1-inspired powerplant.\n\nWhile its previous M5 versions were more subtle in terms of design, compared with their less-powered 5 Series siblings, the 2005 model was more daring. It sported an aggressive styling for the front bumper with a wide, V-shaped lower grille flanked on the sides by functional scoops needed to cool the brakes. On the front fenders, the carmaker installed a pair of vents with M5 badging. Its unique, 19\u201d, 10-spoke light-alloy wheels gave the car a sportier look. From the back, a quad-exhaust system warned the bystanders that this was not regular 5 Series.\n\nThe carmaker installed all the goodies it had on the storage on the interior, such as high-bolstered seats at the front and a wide center console fitted with the iDrive infotainment controller. The leather upholstery covered the seats, the bench, the door panels, and the front center armrest. For the dashboard, the design team imagined a two-cluster design, with the one in the middle for the infotainment unit while the one in front of the driver was for the dials and gauges. \n\nUnder the hood, BMW installed a Formula 1-inspired V10 powerplant. It provided 400 hp on regular driving modes and up to 507 while in M-mode. It paired it to a standard seven-speed automatic (SMG) transmission. On the US market a six-speed manual was available as an option."

    "model_description": "Introduced at the 1998 Geneva Motor Show, the E39 M5 was the fastest sedan in the world at that time, and it stunned its audience since it dropped the inline-six powerplant.It was the third generation of the M-badged moniker of the 5 Series, and it had to come with something exciting. Its predecessor, the E34 M5, was already praised for its qualities. But for the E39 version, everything had to be upgraded. And it was.\n\nThe car's exterior was very little changed compared with the non-M version. At the front, the bumper was different and featured a lower apron with a broad grille flanked by the foglights fitted as standard. Starting with the 2001 model year, BMW introduced the so-called \"corona-lights\" for DRL, encircling the headlamps with an illuminated ring. Apart from the front spoiler, the M5 featured a lip spoiler on the trunk lid. Last but not least, a quad exhaust adorned the redesigned rear bumper.\n\nInside, BMW installed a pair of high-bolstered bucket seats at the front and a bench in the rear. The leather-wrapped interior was fitted as standard, with an option for Alcantara. On the center stack, the carmaker offered a premium sound system and, as an option, navigation. However, starting with 2001, that was changed to a DVD-based Navi system.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW installed a 4.9 V8 powerplant. It provided a healthy dose of adrenaline due to its 400 PS (394 hp) and 500 Nm (369 lb-ft). The only available transmission was a six-speed manual which sent the oomph to the rear via a limited-slip differential. For the U.S. market, the carmaker installed simple vented discs. At the same time, the Europeans got floating ventilated discs, which reduced the unsprung masses."

    "model_description": "The first M5 was introduced on the first-generation very late, when the car was almost out of production line.For the second generation though, BMW decided to offer it from the start.\n\nThe battle for the sport-sedan market had begun when the BMW M3 and the Mercedes-Benz 190 2.5-16 started to compete against each other on the track of the DTM races. That also started a competition on the sales floor where both manufacturers succeeded to gain respect and appreciation from their customers. Customers who noticed that fast and luxurious could fit in the same vehicle.\n\nThe production of the second generation of the BMW 5-Series started in 1987, but it was launched at the beginning of the following year. In September 1988, the M-version was ready to meet its customers. The E34 M5 was not very striking. It looked more like a regular 5-Series with different wheels and slightly different bumpers and sills. That was the idea: to offer a performance vehicle that looked just like a regular one.\n\nInside there was a different story. Its front seats were bucket-type and offered good lateral support on cornering. The M-letter along with its three light-blue, dark-blue, and red lines on the dashboard. The electrically adjustable steering column was a rare feature on the market. On the center console, there was a trip-computer that looked weird with a lot of buttons and a small, LED, screen.\n\nThe magic was under the hood where a naturally aspirated 6-cylinder was installed. The M5 was offered with a 3.5-liter between 1988 and 1991. After that, a 3.8-liter unit was installed. These engines offered 315 hp and 340 hp, respectively. It was mated to a standard 5-speed manual up to 1994. The 6-speed manual was offered only for a year."

    "model_description": "The first generation of the BMW M5 came out on the market in 1985 and its main weapon was highly concealed under a bodywork that looked the same as on a basic 5-Series with nicer wheels.By the time when the second generation of the BMW 5-Series was launched, the whole company design language was established, with the shark-nose profile for the whole range. The first vehicle which featured that front profile was the 7-Series and it was followed by the 6-series. The development for the second generation started in 1985 and it involved the spare-parts department and the accounting computer. It was the only computer in the company. \n\nThe E28 5 Series was launched in 1981 and it was a simple, four-door sedan. It was meant to be a car for the premium customers, with decent performance and better handling than the competition, mainly the Mercedes-Benz. In 1984, the M 535 I was launched, and it was a commercial success with its 218 hp engine. But that was not all. The four-door sedan was improved once again in 1985 with the first, true, M5. It featured the M88/3 engine, which was used on the 3.0 CSL race-car and in the famous BMW M1. The twin-cam, 24 valves unit offered 286 hp and that was only a part of what the M5 could offer. A 5-speed manual transmission was the only option.\n\nFrom the outside, only a few clues would tell the difference. There were a special bumper, side-sills, and a rear deck-spoiler. On the grille, a small M5 badge was installed as well as in the rear. Special BBS light-alloy wheels were standard for the top-model. At the time of the launch, it was the fastest 4-door sedan in the world."

    "model_description": "The M 535i was the first road car produced by the BMW Motorsport GmbH and launched in 1979 as a high-performance sedan and started the horsepower competition.While the M1 was produced in a limited number to promote the new badge and eventually became a legend, the M 535i was a regular sedan with more power than any other BMW production vehicle. It had the heart of a race-car, a tuned suspension and a few bodywork enhancements.\n\nThe first 5-Series was part of the BMW range since 1972, and it was already a common view on the streets. Paul Bracq signed the car's design and imagined that raked forward front fascia making the car looks like a shark. But when he had to adjust the M version, he added an apron with vents under the bumper. From its sides, the M 535i sported a set of magnesium wheels, unique for that version. In the back, the carmaker added a lip-spoiler on the trunk to create some downforce on the rear axle.\n\nInside, Motorsport GmbH installed sport bucket-seats provided by Recaro with high bolstering for the front passengers. The dashboard was similar to the rest of the range, with the tilted toward driver center stack and a clock on top of it. Inside the instrument cluster, the M 535i sported wide dials for the tachometer and speedometer and two smaller gauges for the fuel level and coolant temperature.\n\nBut the real transformation took place hidden under the bodywork. The carmaker installed a 3.5-liter, inline-six engine that produced 218 hp thanks to its injection system. It was paired as standard to a five-speed manual. The suspension was stiffened to ensure a higher cornering speed than its siblings. BMW produced only 1400 units of it between 1979 and 1981."

    "model_description": "The third generation of the BMW 1-Series was a revolution for the small German car since it was based on a front-wheel-drive platform.But it didn't mean it was less performant. \n\nThe success story of the 1-Series began in 2004. The sporty, nimble, small car gathered attention from everybody. The second generation was launched in 2011 and it continued the big sales numbers that reached 1.8-million units by the time the third generation appeared.\n\nFrom first sight, it is impossible not to notice the huge kidney-grille. The angled headlights are going upwards along with the front fenders into a more accentuated slope toward the A-pillars. Since the front-wheel-drive platform was with transverse engines, the whole front of the vehicle was shorter than the one on the previous generation. The shorter front of the car allowed a bigger greenhouse with a long roofline that dropped away toward the rear. A wide tail with big shoulders over the rear wheel arches emphasized the car's sporty look.\n\nInside the cabin, there was more room than in the previous generation, since the engine and transmission were in front of the windshield. Since there was more room for the front seats, those were installed forward and in effect, the rear legroom was bigger. The driver had a TFT display instead of the usual dials in the instrument cluster. A new infotainment unit that features gesture controls were installed.\n\nUnder the hood, there was a wide variety of engines, both diesel, and gasoline with manual or automatic transmission. For specific engine versions, an all-wheel-drive system was available."

    "model_description": "BMW did the last upgrade for the second generation of the 1 Series (F20) in 2017, before changing the generation in 2019.It is usual for a carmaker to improve a vehicle around the middle of that model's lifespan, and BMW named that upgrade as LCI (Life Cycle Impulse). It's like a small bump to increase the sales and dust-off some systems which are no longer trendy among its customers. The 1 Series was the only rear-wheel-drive premium compact hatchback on the market, and the German carmaker bragged about that until it followed the trend and switched to a front-wheel-drive system in 2019.\n\nThere were minor changes to the car's exterior. It brought the new Edition Sport Line Shadow, Edition M Sport Shadow, and BMW M140i Edition Shadow special editions. These underlined the car's sporty look introducing a black kidney grille, black inserts in the LED headlights and darkened LED taillights.\n\nInside, BMW finally introduced the touch-screen infotainment system. While the German carmaker was the first to introduce a combined interface that gathered the audio, phone, and navigation into one unit and named-it iDrive on the BMW 7 Series, it waited a while to offer it with a touch-screen system. The sporty interior look was still the same, with very limited room in the rear due to the high center tunnel needed for the transmission.\n\nBMW kept the three-cylinder engines for the base versions on the engine department, but the customers had a vast choice of engines to chose from. Like its predecessor, the 1-Series featured a rear- or all-wheel-drive system."

The 6.5 inches color display is also standard and integrated into the dashboard. It doesn't look like it was installed by the dealers afterward.\n\nThe long hood, big wheelbase, and short overhangs add a sporty look to the vehicle. And, in the proper versions and with the proper outside option pack, it is not just a look. It is a warning. The kidney-grille got bigger, and as an option, the reshaped headlights can be equipped with full LED lights. The front bumper inspires an aggressive look.\n\nUnder the hood, there is a big range of powertrains, with manual or automatic transmissions. For the first time, the 1 Series can be equipped with the 8-speed Steptronic gearbox from the Japanese manufacturer Aisin.\nFive petrol and five diesel engines with BMW TwinPower Turbo technology are available for the 2015 BMW 1-Series. Setting the pace in terms of sports performance is the BMW M135i M with an inline-6 engine now producing 326 hp. The most fuel-efficient is the BMW 116d EfficientDynamics Edition, which combines 116 hp with low fuel consumption of 3.4 liters per 100 kilometers (69.1 mpg-US). Customers can also choose the all-wheel-drive system, BMW xDrive, for the BMW M135i, BMW 120d, and BMW 118d."

    "model_description": "In 2004, BMW introduced a model that changed the entire brand: the 1-Series.It was considered the true successor for the legendary BMW 3-Series E30 from the '80s. In 2007 it was enhanced.\n\nThe facelift introduced a new bodywork version, a new interior, and new engines. It was a major revamp for the range. Along with the new, three-door version, the entire range was refreshed and updated.\n\nFrom the outside, the 1-Series with three doors featured a slightly different profile. The longer front doors and the tilting front seats made room for the rear passengers to enter or exit the car. The rear side windows were smaller than on the five-door version. On the front, all the range was fitted with a new grille and a new bumper. The larger kidney-grille was redesigned to improve the air-flow, and, in the back, a restyled pair of taillights completed the image.\n\nInside, the dashboard changed and the new infotainment system allowed iPod or USB connectivity, but not Android Auto. There was also a button to disable the new automatic start-stop system, which was automatically engaged every time the car was started. For the rear passengers, there wasn't enough legroom or headroom, especially due to the transmission tunnel. The trunk-space was smaller than all the compact-class hatchbacks on the market.\n\nFor the engine compartment, BMW 1 Series offered a choice of eight diesel and gasoline units. Apart from the base diesel unit, which was paired exclusively with a 6-speed manual, all of the others were mated with either a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic."

    "model_description": "Following a rather disappointing run with the 3 Series Compact model, BMW launched a brand new 5-door hatchback in 2004, called the 1 Series.This model was based on an entirely new E87 automobile platform and became the smallest vehicle in BMW's current model range. \n\nIt also shared most of its components with the 3 Series (including axle configuration and suspension) and was designed to challenge Audi A3, Volkswagen Golf, Volvo C30, Mercedes-Benz B-Class, Acura CSX and Saab 9-1 on the small luxury car sector. This model received a facelift in 2007, coinciding with the introduction of the 3-door hatch or 1 Series Coupe."

    "model_description": "It was the bold move no-one thought was going to become a trend-setter more then a decade ago when BMW launched the first generation of the X6.The SUV-Coupe (called by the Bavarians Sport-Activity-Coupe) was followed a decade later by more than one competitor. But the real star of the SUV-coupe segment, was and remained the X6. In 2019, BMW decided to come with a new generation. Now it is even bolder and meaner. As a plus, the Bavarians added some bling-bling equipping the car with 22\u201d rims and lights in the front-grille. \n\nInside, there is room for 5. The first generation had 4 individual seats as standard, those from the back being divided by a large center console. \n\nUnder the hood, BMW offers gasoline and diesel engines, all turbocharged. The \u201cslowest\u201d version has 265 hp and can do a 0-100 kph (62 mph) in under 7 seconds, while the top of the range X6 M Competition can reach the first 100 kph (62 mph) in a mere 3.8 seconds due to its 625 hp and massive 750 Nm (553 lb-ft) of torque. \n\nSince the new generation was launched under new rules of connectivity, the evolution of the infotainment system is massive. From the previous iDrive with a rotary knob to BMW Live Cockpit Professional is a big leap. Also, there is a personal AI assistant that can receive a custom name so the driver won't have to say \u201cHey, BMW!\u201d each time he wants a command. Two over 12\u201d screens are available for the instrument cluster and the main screen. Of course, it supports Android Auto and Apple CarPlay."

    "model_description": "Although not a proper facelift, BMW fielded a new diesel engine lineup for 2010 and introduced the ActiveHybrid version of the X6 in late 2009, dubbed the most powerful production hybrid in the world at the time.The normal X6 model received two uprated diesel engines, namely the 30d and the 40d with 245 hp and 306 hp, respectively. While the car remained the same in appearance, the ActiveHybrid variant boasts some distinctive design features, like the prominent Powerdome engine lid, \u201cActiveHybrid\u201d logos, specific 19-inch alloy wheels and an exclusive exterior paint called Bluewater metallic, for the first time featured on an X6.\n\nThe hybrid X6 can run in three modes: internal combustion, all-electric or a mix of both. The all-electric operation can be maintained at speeds up to 65 kph (40 mph) resulting in zero emissions whatsoever. With a 4.4L V8 gasoline unit and 485 hp, the BMW X6 ActiveHybrid packs a lot of punch, managing a 0 to 100 kph (0-62 mph) sprint in just 5.6 seconds. But those who will want the ActiveHybrid version will have to lose the adaptive suspension system. \n\nOne of the most anticipated changes was for the rear passengers, where the pre-facelift version had only two individual seats separated by a hard center console. Now there is an option to have a rear bench seat, but don't count for too much room, though."

The BMW actually referred to the vehicle as a SAC \u2013 Sport Activity Coupe. \n\nThe X6 had an aggressive look and the descending roofline amplified the sporty look. For some people, it was hard to understand that X6 handling was actually in the performance-car territory. \n\nInside, there was room for four people. On the back-seat, there was not even a place for a potential third passenger. The trunk was smaller than those on some compact-class vehicles and it couldn't be extended by folding the rear seats. It featured a standard infotainment iDrive system with a large LCD display in the dashboard. \n\nUnder the hood, there was a good variety of engines, both diesel and gasoline. But one of the best version was the X6 3.5 d that offered up to 286 hp and 660 Nm (486 lb-ft). But the X6 had some other options to offer. The 6-speed automatic transmission was standard."

    "model_description": "The X5 M was the top-performer of the X5 range and provided more power and torque than its predecessor, and, for those who thought that 600 hp are not enough, BMW offered an upgraded version.When BMW introduced the first generation of the X5 in 1999, it became a sales-winner. It featured a unit-body construction, and that made it lighter than its main competitor, the Mercedes-Benz ML, which featured a body-on-frame architecture. Thus, BMW's first SUV became a tough competitor for all other premium carmakers. Fast forward two decades, and the X5 M came on the market with more power than three first-generation X5.\n\nThe 2019 X5 M featured a new front bumper than the rest of the X5 range. It sported a wider lower grille flanked by a pair of side-scoops and two more others on the car's apron. Its aggressive look was not only for show. All the scoops and air intakes were calculated by the company's engineers and were fully functional.\n\nThe leather-clad X5 interior featured a pair of high-bolstered seats at the front separated by a tall and wide center stack. Its sport bucket seats for the front passengers provided great side support for their occupants. In the back, there was the same flat bench with a 40/20/40 split system that increased the car's trunk from 650 liters to a maximum of 1,870 liters. The dashboard featured a pair of slim vents on the center stack, under the wide, 12.3\" infotainment display. For the 2019 model, the X6 M sported a 12.3\" digital instrument panel.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW M installed an evolved 4.4-liter twin-turbo engine. Unlike its predecessor, which offered 575 hp, the 2019 model provided 600 hp for the regular M and 625 for the Competition Package version."

    "model_description": "The big SUV from BMW received an M-Technik implant in 2014.The Motorsport department developed the most powerful engine for an all-wheel-drive BMW ever and installed it in the X5. First, it took the 4.4-liter V8 gasoline engine and then plugged a pair of TwinScroll turbocharges, cross-bank exhaust manifolds, VALVETRONIC and High Precision Direct Gasoline Injection system. The result is a total output of 575 hp and 750 Nm (553 lb-ft) of torque. To send this energy to the wheels, M engineers installed a newly developed 8-speed Steptronic automatic gearbox.\n\nFrom the outside, a new aerodynamic package was added. Large air intakes at the front end, side gills with a model badge and air breathers, signature M exterior mirrors in twin-stalk style, a typically M four-tailpipe exhaust system give it a standalone look M fans will immediately recognize. Setting the seal on this exclusive range of features are M-specific 20-inch light-alloy wheels with mixed tires or forged 21-inch M light-alloy wheels (optional).\n\nThe interior is fit for a high-performance vehicle, even if it is an SUV. As with all cars from the BMW brand, the design of the interior prioritizes intuitive usability. Also, M GmbH makes its own distinctive mark here. For example, the BMW X5 M come with a newly developed, ergonomically optimized M leather steering wheel with gearshift paddles, while the M gearshift lever has an equally distinctive design. The instrument cluster, M Drive menu in the information display, displays in the optional Head-Up Display and special multifunction switch with M Drive buttons on the steering wheel also fit the M template."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced the most potent X5 to that date and added the notorious M badge on it, confirming that it can provide performance at any level for any ground clearance.The X5 and X6 M were the first all-wheel-drive vehicles that ever sported the M-logo. Before that, the carmaker provided powerful versions ever since the first generation, with the 4.4-liter and the 4.6-liter engines, but those were not considered worthy enough to wear the magic light-blue, navy-blue, and red logo. That version came only on the second generation of the X5 in 2009.\n\nAny M car had to tick more boxes than any other BMW, and the X5 followed the same procedure. BMW's motorsport department enhanced the car's look with new front bumpers with enlarged air dams. Two large and rectangular air scoops flanked the center lower grille. On its sides, the carmaker added M-specific badges on the front fenders. From its profile, the 20\" light-alloy wheels with unique design emphasized the car's performance, while at the back, the four exhausts confirmed it.\n\nInside, the X5 featured a leather-clad interior with specific M-badges on the steering wheel, the gear selector, and inside the tachometer. Its power-adjustable sport bucket-seats promised good side support with their adjustable bolsters. Piano-black trims adorned the center console, the door cards, and the dashboard. Last but not least, a pair of aluminum paddle-shifters was mounted behind the steering wheel. For the rear passengers, BMW offered the same spacious split-folding bench.\n\nBMW's motorsport department installed a twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 engine under the hood paired with a six-speed automatic transmission that sent the power in all corners. For stopping, the car featured four-pot calipers at the front and single-pot in the rear, while the all-wheel independent suspension was enhanced with adaptive dampers."

    "model_description": "The fourth generation of the BMW X5 was introduced in 2018 and, after 2.2 million units sold from its previous three generations, it reached a high level of maturity.\n\nThe BMW X5 was one of the most popular premium SUVs on the market. Its high volume of sales convinced the German car-maker to improve the vehicle up to a level hard to reach by any of its competitors.\n\nThe massive grille design of the 2018 BMW X5 was not on everyone's taste. The headlights design was slimmer and in the same aesthetic trend as the rest of the BMW range. They came with LED as standard while BMW Laserlight with Adaptive LED Headlights was available as an option. The car featured standard 18\u201d light-alloy wheels for the base trim level. The rear split tailgate was kept and was offered with standard power opening and closing.\n\nInside, there was room for five adults and a split rear bench backseat int 40:20:40 scheme. There were plenty of USB ports and 12V plugs in the rear. An option for two 10.2\u201d touch-screen displays was available for the rear-seat entertainment. In the front, the driver had a digital instrument cluster with a TFT instead of analog dials. On the center console, there was the infotainment unit and screen. It could be activated by voice-commands, gestures, steering wheel buttons, and the iDrive rotary knob on the center console.\n\nThe engine ranged from a 2.0-liter turbocharged diesel up to a 4.4-liter V8 turbocharged gasoline unit. While the former was not available in the U.S., the latter was not produced for Europe. The standard transmission was an 8-speed automatic gearbox. More performance models were available fitted with either 3.0-liter diesel engines or the M-version."

    "model_description": "In 2014, BMW came with the third generation of its revolutionary SUV that held the crown for the sales in its segment.Considering this, it had to be one step ahead of the competition.\n\nIn times when all the 4x4 vehicles were big and chassis-based, BMW took the chance when it owned the Land Rover brand and, with their know-how, the BMW engineers built an SUV with no transfer case, no low-gear and with unibody construction, unlike its main rival that built the first-generation of ML on a ladder-chassis. \n\nThe look of the 2014 X5 was clearly a BMW. The kidney-grille on the front was bigger than before, and they were extended from one headlight to another. It featured optional Adaptive LED headlights, identified by a horizontal light source on the center of the light rings. For the X5 5.0i and the X5 M50d, the xenon headlights were standard. \n\nInside, the high seating position allowed the constructor to design a very roomy interior. It was a truly 5-seater vehicle The infotainment unit had a 10.25\u201d color display, controlled via the standard iDrive rotary knob from the center console. There were few options for that, and one had a touch-pad on top of the knob to write the names or the numbers of an address for the navigation system.\n\nFor the first time, the X5 was available with a small, 2.0-liter engine and with rear-wheel-drive only. But the top performers had over 400 hp and plenty of torque to deal with. The standard transmission was an 8-speed automatic. The X5 also had a plug-in hybrid version."

The rear bumper and tailpipe surrounds were also redesigned. The new BMW X5 is equipped with adaptive brake lights, runflat safety tires and a tire defect indicator. BMW implemented its EfficientDynamics suite on all the new X5 models and revised its entire engine lineup to achieve substantial fuel efficiency and lowered CO2 emissions. Another important feature of the new X5 is that all models are fitted with an 8-speed automatic gearbox with Steptronic as standard. BMW also made sure its new technologies, like the Head-up Display, Adaptive Cornering Headlights, High-Beam Assistant, Park Distance Control and reversing camera with Surround View, Active Cruise Control with Stop & Go function, Lane Departure Warning, Speed limit Info and Side View are all available for the BMW X5."

    "model_description": "The German carmaker introduced the second generation of the X5 in 2007, improving the entire vehicle from top to bottom.While the first generation of the X5 was based on the BMW 5-Series E39, its successor came with a new platform. Apart from the height, all of the other measurements were increased. Thus, the second generation of the X5 became the first BMW to offer a 7-seat option in the German carmaker lineup.\n\nThe flame-surfacing design concept imagined by Chris Bangle was at its peak when the X5 was introduced in 2007. With its big headlights and flowing lines, the German SUV didn't want to look streamlined, but massive. The bulky grille and the \"BMW kidneys\" were more significant, and the fenders were wider.\n\nThe interior offered room for five adult passengers, with an option for an extra row of seats in the back for another two. The manufacturer installed an instrument cluster with four dials and a small screen for the on-board computer for the driver. As an option, the iDrive infotainment unit was offered in a few versions, the top one offering sat-nav and a premium sound system.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW installed a choice of diesel and gasoline engines with 6 and 8 cylinders, providing a power output ranging between 235 hp and 355 hp. All versions were offered with an all-wheel-drive system."

Both brands had experience in luxury products, but only Land Rover had a true off-road heritage. The hill descent control, the split-tailgate, and the torque distribution method were parts that made the X5 a great success.\n\nThe X5 was based on the E39 5-Series platform and that kept the production costs lower. The design lines were taken from the 5-Series as well. At the facelift, a new set of headlights, grille, and bumpers were installed. The taillights were redesigned as well and new wheels were introduced.\n\nInside, there were not too many modifications. A new infotainment system was available, with a color display on the center stack. The GPS-navigation system was a good addition. A big, panoramic, roof was added to the options list.\n\nFor the engine compartment, the X5 received more powerful engines. The 4.6-liter V8 was replaced by a 4.8-liter unit. The diesel engine, which was the most demanded version on the European market was upgraded from 184hp to 218hp. The most important update to the drivetrain was the introduction of the 6-speed automatic instead of the older 5-speed, while the xDrive (all-wheel-drive) system was upgraded."

It was shown in late 1990 and the sales started in 1991.\n\nThe E36 was a complete change in the 3-series design. From the exposed rounded headlights to newly developed twin headlamps under the same glass, it was a big step and many fans didn't agree with it. But the car was better from any point of view. The new suspension, bigger wheelbase and bigger engines were enough to place the car on top of the premium compact-sized sedans on the market. And the coupe went a step further with its doors with frameless windows.\n\nThe interior featured a dashboard turned toward the driver, with accessible controls and a good layout. The low sitting position was very well received by the customers who were looking for a true sports car at a decent price. In the rear, there was enough room for two adults. Depending on the trim level and options checked on the list, there were front highly bolstered seats, heated and power-adjustable.\n\nUnder the hood, the basic engine was a carry-over from the E30, but that changed from the facelift model that happened in 1995. The top model, apart from the M3, was the 328i version, with a newly developed 2.8-liter unit. The standard transmission for the entire range was a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic was offered as an option."

But the M3 didn't die; it just got better.\n\nThe seventh generation of the BWM 3 Series was introduced in 2018, but the M3 fans had to wait for another two years to get the top-spec version. The 2020 M3 featured a redesigned front bumper with more aggressive styling. A muscular stance and the flared arches ensured an important image for the sportiest 3-Series. The specific 18\u201d light-alloy wheels were fitted as standard. In the back, the car was fitted with four exhausts. An optional performance package gathered all four pipes in the middle.\n\nInside, the car was fitted with sport-bucket seats as standard. The instrument cluster featured a TFT color display and, on the center stack, the infotainment system was installed. It featured connectivity via Apple CarPlay and it could support Android phones. If the car was fitted with the automatic gearbox, it was fitted with a pair of paddle-shifters as well.\n\nUnder the hood, the M3 surprised its customers with the introduction of the all-wheel-drive system. It was the first M3 in history to send its power to all four wheels. The standard gearbox was a six-speed manual. For that, the power went exclusively to the rear wheels. The xDrive version was available only in conjunction with the 8-speed automatic."

    "model_description": "Almost three decades after introducing the E30 M3 Evolution, BMW launched a special version for the F80 M3: the M3 CS.BMW had a long history of making light, agile cars derived from the M3. It all started in 1988 with the M3 Evolution and continued with the M3-CSL, CRT, or the GTR. In 2017, the German carmaker introduced a new special version of the M3: the CS. It was lighter, with better weight distribution and more power than the regular version. On top of that, it moved the speed limiter from 155 mph (250 kph) to 174 mph (280 kph).\n\nBoth the hood and the roof were made out of carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP), which shaved 10 kg (22 lbs) from the vehicle's weight. On the trunk's rear edge, BMW added a different carbon-fiber lip-spoiler than on the regular M3. The apron featured a three-section air intake. Its big, 19\" light-alloy wheels at the front were complemented by a set of 22\" rims at the back. Under the rear bumper, the carmaker installed a diffuser and four exhaust pipes.\n\nInside, BMW didn't forget that its customers had to pay a six-figure price and created a sporty yet luxurious interior. The carmaker installed a two-tone leather upholstery adorned with Alcantara on the center console and door cards. Another significant standard feature was the infotainment unit and the Harman Kardon sound system Professional.\n\nWith a lowered, stiffened suspension and a 460 hp under the hood, the M3 CS was clearly faster than a regular M3. The engine sent its power to the rear wheels via a seven-speed (dual-clutch) automatic transmission and was quicker by 0.4 seconds than a regular M3."

So, the 3-Series coupe became 4-Series. But that didn't mean to throw away the M3 badges. Those were applied to the four-door BMW 3-Series.\n\nIn 2014, BMW announced the sportiest version of the 3-Series, the M3. On the outside, it looked different than the rest of the stable, featuring a new front bumper with a bigger spoiler and wider side-pods as air-intakes. On the front fenders, a set of air-vents enhanced the look of the car, and minimized turbulences in the front wheel arches. Unlike its predecessor, which ad a bulge on the hood due to its massive V8 engine, the M3 had a smaller one more for design purposes and for pedestrian protection. A specific set of 18\u201d light-alloy wheels was installed on the car. In the back, there were four exhausts under the diffuser, which was specifically designed for the M3.\n\nInside, the M3 showed its family roots in the motorsport arena. High-bolstered seats, special steering wheel, special instrument cluster, and the three-color of the M badge spread around the cabin, on the seats, on the gear-stick, and on the dials.\n\nThe 2014 M3, also known as the F80, was the first turbocharged BMW M3. It featured an inline-six unit under the hood. Its 3.0-liter displacement was smaller than the former 4.0-liter V8 of the E92 M3. But it offered more power and more torque than the model it replaced. It was mated as standard to a 6-speed manual and there was an option for a 7-Speed dual-clutch automatic gearbox."

    "model_description": "The fourth generation of the M3 and the third generation of the four-door M3 was introduced in 2007 and it was the benchmark in the sport-sedan market.It was the car to beat.\n\nThe M3 history started in the '80s with a car built for the street to receive the FIA type approval for the track. The successful E30 M3 was produced only as a two-door vehicle and its successor, the E36 M3, received a four-door version. After that, all of the other M3s were available like that as well as coupe or convertible.\n\nThe M3 sedan was easy to differentiate from a standard sedan. In the front, there was a new bumper with a larger grille in the center and two air-dams on the sides. The hood featured a bulge, needed to make room for the bigger engine. From the side, new door mirrors were installed and in the back, four exhaust placed closer to the center were revealed under the bumper.\n\nInside, the car featured the three colors from the Motorsport GmBH: blue, dark blue, and red, stitched to the upholstery, on the steering wheel and the instrument cluster. The M3 logo was shown as well. The bucket-seats for the front passengers offered a high level of grip in the cornering for its occupants.\n\nBut the magic of the M3 was underneath its skin. A 4.0-liter V8 engine in the front sent its power via a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed automatic gearbox (dual-clutch). The car was quicker to 100 kph (62 mph) by 0.2 seconds when equipped with the automatic gearbox. The perfect balance and weight distribution granted a great level of cornering speed."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced the second generation of the M3 in 1992 as a coupe, and two years later, it unveiled the four-door version for it.While the E30 M3 was available only as a coupe, the second generation was available with a four-door sedan and a convertible bodywork. Thus, those who needed a four-door vehicle that was fun to drive and sporty had the option to get one from the German automaker.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, the second generation of the M3 was more subtle. It took someone with a keen eye for detail to distinguish an M-version from a regular one. But there were a few details that revealed the differences. For starters, the front bumper was different. Unlike its regular sibling, the M3 sedan featured an apron that sported a rectangular air intake in the middle, flanked on the sides by two small scoops and squared fog lamps. On the profile, the door mirrors were aerodynamically profiled and mounted on the bodywork with two thinner supports instead of a single, wider one. Moreover, the rocker panels were sculptured so they could divert the air from the sides and prevent it from entering under the car. Finally, at the back, the M3 sedan received a diffuser under the bumper and a wing on the trunk.\n\nInside, the automaker installed a three-spoke steering wheel with a small M-badge on the lower one. All versions got high-bolstered bucket seats at the front with multiple adjustments. As an option, BMW offered leather upholstery. Also standard was a high-fi sound system and an onboard computer. Worth noticing that the red line on the tachometer started at 7,500 rpm.\n\nUnder the hood, the car was introduced with a 3.0-liter inline-six engine that developed 286 PS for the European market but just 240 for the U.S. customers. In 1995, the German automaker upgraded the powerplant to a 3.2-liter displacement that led to 321 PS for European customers but the same 240 ponies for the U.S. market."

    "model_description": "Thanks to the immense success achieved by its bigger brothers, the M3 CS and the M4 CS, the first ever BMW M2 CS is a limited edition model that is also the base for a racing car.With a much sharper exterior design than the M2 Competition, more power and various sporty or lightweight components making their way onto the model, the new M2 CS will surely get a massive fan base.\n\nJust like the M2 Competition, the M2 Club Sport is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six, with the powerplant having been borrowed from its bigger brothers, the M3 and M4. With an output of 450 horsepower, the car is not only more powerful than the M2 Competition, but trumps even its engine donors' cars. Exterior updates include a carbon fiber engine hood with an air intake right in the middle, which apparently not only aid in engine cooling but also increases downforce over the front axle. For the first time ever, BMW Motorsport has also optioned the M2 with a carbon fiber roof for the Club Sport, which not only lowers the center of gravity but also makes the body of the car more rigid for better handling. The M Sport brakes are larger than the ones fitted to the M2 Competition as well, with the front discs having a diameter of no less than 400 mm."

    "model_description": "The M2 was a serious sports car that made many people ask if it wouldn't be a better track-car than the bigger M4.With the introduction of the Competition version, the answer was even difficult.\n\nThe German carmaker had a thing with the sport-compact sedans ever since the first BMW M3 was introduced in the '80s. Even though that car was built to get the FIA's race-approval, the carmaker insisted and developed a complete range of M-Power vehicles. The M2 was the smallest, but not the slowest.\n\nThe M2 Competition received a new bumper and specific air-intakes to cool the brakes and the engine from the outside. The enlarged BMW kidneys were painted in black, improving the aggressive look of the car. The side vents on the front fenders were black as well. The four exhausts mirrored the same color in the back, differentiating the M2 Competition from the other M Competition models. The M2 Competition was available with an exclusive color: Hockenheim Silver.\n\nThe interior was fit for a day at the track with sport-bucket seats at the front. The M2 competition badge was embroiled on the front seats' seatbacks and was present on the door-sills. For the instrument cluster, the designers chose a black background with red needles and white lettering.\n\nThe most important elements were on the technical sides. The 3.0-liter, twin-turbo engine offered 410 hp. It was mated to a standard 6-speed manual gearbox while a 7-speed automatic (dual-clutch) was on the options list. An electronically controlled rear differential offered the best traction available."

    "model_description": "The BMW 2 Series was a great addition to the German car manufacturer.It was the car that young people desired, in the correct body shape and with a fair price for what it offered. But the top of the range M2 was something even more.\n\nThe BMW M2 was launched at the Mazda Laguna Seca Raceway and it was the proper place to show its pace. The differences between the M2 and the other 2-Series were obvious. A different bumper with larger air intakes and flared wheel-arches warned the drivers that under the hood were more hp than the standard 2 Series. A rear spoiler on the trunk lid and a quad-exhaust under the reshaped bumper confirmed that there were more ponies under the hood.\n\nFor the track experience, the M2 was fitted with the optional M-DCT gearbox. The brakes were the same as from the M3/M4. The big differences were under the hood where the twin-turbo system from the M3/M4 was replaced with a twin-scroll turbocharger. The result was 61 hp less than the bigger brother, but only a small fraction from 0 to 100 kph (0-62 mph). The M2 didn't have all the good things from its bigger brother, such as the carbon-fiber drive-shaft but so, the price was lower.\n\nThe car had an adaptive suspension that made it very comfortable on the road and very nimble. Its wider tracks front and rear, due to a new, aluminum, suspension made it more planted on the road when compared with the regular 2 Series."

    "model_description": "The first generation of the 2-Series Gran Tourer was introduced in June 2015.It was the second shock for the German brand's fans, which couldn't accept a front-wheel-drive BWM.\n\nBut the BMW management didn't back up and backed-up the project. They knew that the market needed a small vehicle able to carry more people inside a city and a regular 2- or 3-Series just wouldn't fit the needs. Meanwhile, the Mercedes-Benz already had the A-Class and the B-Class which were suitable for that customer segment.\n\nDespite its compact size, the 2-Series Gran Tourer offered enough room for five adults plus two children inside. Since it used the same platform as a Mini, with a transverse engine, the designers had more room for the cabin. The rear side of the car was extended when compared to the Active Tourer, to accommodate an extra set of seats in the trunk area. The facelift brought a new front fascia, with a larger and taller grille design, and new headlights.\n\nInside, the center stack was tilted toward the driver, emphasizing its role. There were new materials used for the interior and a new BMW M-Performance package. The longer seat cushions made the vehicle more comfortable on long journeys. The customers could choose from different trim levels, including Luxury Line, Sport Line, and M Sport packages.\n\nFor the powertrain, the facelift received a wide choice of three- and four-cylinder units, plus a plug-in hybrid. The 2-Series Gran Tourer was available with a choice of a manual or automatic transmission, including a new, 7-speed dual-clutch one."

    "model_description": "The 2-Series Gran Tourer from BMW was the first modern try of the German car-maker to enter the small MPV market, with a premium vehicle that offered more room and luxury for the segment.The Gran Tourer was the seven-seat version of the 2014 BMW 2-Series Active Tourer. Despite bearing the 2-Series name, the car was related more to the MINI hatchback than to the 2-Series. It featured a front-wheel-drive architecture instead of a rear-wheel-drive one, as used by the regular 2-Series.\n\nThe front looked different than a regular BMW, but still featured the kidney-grille design. The headlights didn't have that \u201cangry-face\u201d from its siblings, but more like a calming down look. With the raked A-pillars almost in the same line with the hood line, the 2-Series Gran Tourer featured a classic profile of an MPV. The long roofline was longer than on the Active Tourer. The last row of side windows, behind the rear doors, were longer than on its 5-passenger sibling.\n\nInside, there were the same high-quality materials as in a regular BMW 2-Series. The flat dashboard design was carried over from the 2-Series Active Tourer. The infotainment system featured an option for a 6.5\u201d color display on the center stack and it was accessible via the rotary knob of the iDrive system. The last row of seats was foldable and placed in the trunk area.\n\nFor the powertrain, the 2-Series Gran Tourer featured front or all-wheel-drive traction systems. It offered a wide choice of engines with three or four cylinders and power between 116 hp and 192 hp. Unlike the Active Tourer version, it was not available with a plug-in hybrid version."

    "model_description": "With 600 hp under the hood, the X6 M tried to offer more performance for the SUV-lovers in a package that started the SUV-coupe trend.When the first X6 came on the market in 2007, it received as much appreciation as hate from its fans. But BMW didn't care too much about that and pushed forward, and soon, the customers started to like it. By 2019, the X6 was already at its third generation, and its main competitors tried to catch it.\n\nBMW offered a special exterior package for the X6 M. The front bumper sported a unique design with a wide center grille flanked by two side-scoops. In addition to these, another pair of slimmer air-intakes found their place on the lowest side of the apron. The laser light system was a standard feature for the X6 M and X6 M Competition Package. Worth mentioning that every aerodynamic detail of the car was functional, including the twin rear spoilers, mounted at the top side of the liftgate and on the lower flat panel, above the LED taillights. A set of four, round exhausts poked underneath the car.\n\nInside, the carmaker installed a leather-clad cabin. Its front bucket seats with high-bolstered areas and integrated headrest promised excellent side support during hard cornering. For the rear seats, BMW installed a bench for three. The dashboard featured slim vents on the center stack, under the wide, 12.3\" infotainment display. For the 2019 model, the X6 M sported a 12.3\" digital instrument panel.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW M installed an evolved 4.4-liter twin-turbo engine. Unlike its predecessor, which offered 575 hp, the 2019 model provided 600 hp for the regular M and 625 for the Competition Package version."

    "model_description": "Due to its unusual shape and distinctive interior, the BMW i3 was either a car you liked or you didn\u2019t.There was no in between.\n\nThe 4-door hatchback offered seating for four and was one of the most practical, yet premium EV.\n\nThe potential of the i3 was greatly maximised with its made shell made entirely of carbon fiber, a material that was stronger than steel and lighter than aluminum.\n\nFor 2017, BMW introduced a larger battery to improve the driving range. It was available for 2 out of the 3 trim levels available, namely the base and the Range Extender version.\n\nInside the i3 was a roomy interior, with a comfortable seating position. Quietness defined the i3\u2019s cabin in the all-electric mode, with the only exception being the gas generator running when the battery was discharged.\n\nWhile lots of storage spaces were available in the cabin, the i3\u2019s cargo area was a small size and loading heavier items was made uneasy with the high position of the trunk.\n\nThe i3 was equipped with a standard business navigation. Optionally, a professional navigation was available, with a bigger screen and a hard-drive map data. \n\nAn available packaged named Technology + Driving Assistant included adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with collision mitigation. A parallel parking system was available as a stand-alone feature."

In 2017, a new version was launched: the i3s.\n\nBMW sporting heritage is known. The introduction of an electric vehicle in its range was surprising, but when the little i3 was compared from the performance-wise to other electric compact vehicles, it proved to be sportier. The i3s came to add more to the already nimble i3. \n\nThe i3s came along with new color options, including a red and black theme. It also featured a new, exclusive, 20\u201d wheel design. There were few other small details such as reshaped bumpers and a sport suspension that lowered the ground clearance by 10 mm (0.4\u201d) and wider track by 40 mm (1.6\u201d). For the headlights, new full-LED units were installed for both low- and high-beams.\n\nInside the i3s the design and the materials used were premium, eucalyptus unpainted wood.  The natural fiber used for the upholstery also were wood-based. The instrument cluster was a full TFT display. The i3s was roomy and provided easy access due to the four doors and the rear doors were read-hinged. \n\nWith a bigger power and an adjusted DTC (Dynamic Traction Control) mode that boosted agility at higher speeds and during sporty cornering.

    "model_description": "When BMW introduced the i3 on the market in 2013, it sent a shockwave in the premium segment, and it was a clear sign that the carmaker would join the electric revolution.With its minivan shape and short external dimensions, the i3 made the carmaker's fans split between those who loved it and those who hated it. Yet, the car's size was an important advantage for city usage. Its front was short, and even if it sported the same kidney grille that was no longer used to cool an engine behind it. \n\nThe car's headlights were swept back on the sides but still featured the same signature DRL with \"Corona lights.\" One of the most unusual features of the car was the doors. When opened, there was no B-pillar. The rear ones were shorter and rear-hinged, easing the ingress and egress. At the back, the tailgate sported high-mounted taillights, protected from bumps in the parking lot.\n\nThe interior was even more unusual, with a pair of screens: one TFT for the instrument cluster and a second one for the infotainment system. To create a premium feel while still keeping track of the environmentally-friendly materials, BMW used only naturally-treated leather, wool, wood, and recycled materials for the cabin.\n\nBut the biggest revolution was for the drivetrain. BMW designed the car as an EV right from the start. Thus, it created a platform that integrated the battery pack. Even though it was a rear-wheel drive vehicle like most of the other BMWs, it featured a rear-mounted motor placed under the trunk's floor. For those who feared the electric-only autonomy, the carmaker added a two-cylinder internal-combustion engine that served as a power generator and could replenish the batteries. For the EV-only versions, the carmaker offered a choice of two battery packs, which gave the 170 hp vehicle a range of up to 180 km (112 miles). At the same time, the version fitted with a range extender could travel up to 300 km (186 miles)."

In the first 1-Series, the coupe was named just 1-Series Coupe. But no, the marketing department decided that all the coupes should wear an even number, so the 1-Series Coupe became a 2-Series, the 3-Series Coupe became a 4-Series and so on. The 2-Series Convertible shared most of its components with the 1-Series, and it received the last update before completely changing the generation in 2019.\n\nLike its closed-version, the convertible featured a mild update on the exterior. Starting with the 2017 model-year, the 2-Series received standard bi-LED headlights with a flat bottom style. As an option, the carmaker offered LED fog-lights as well. In the rear, the L-shaped taillights featured standard LEDs.\n\nA completely redesigned dashboard featured the screen for the infotainment unit on top of the center stack. The center console housed the iDrive rotary knob controller, while the center-stack kept the controls for the HVAC system. The customers could choose between five new upholstery fabrics or from seven different leather designs.\n\nBMW offered the 2-Series convertible with a choice of eight engines ranged between 136 hp and 340 hp. Depending on the engine, the car featured a 6-speed manual or an eight-speed automatic, with rear- or all-wheel-drive."

    "model_description": "This is the only premium compact convertible on the market: the 2 Series.After introducing the 2 Series, not long after it jumped with the open-top version in 2014. The soft-top was added along with some weight and a little bit of charm.\n\nThe soft top consists of seven layers of different materials to enhance soundproofing and thermal insulation. It is electrically powered and it goes down in 20 seconds. The good thing is that the car doesn't look bad with the roof up, as it happens with some convertibles. \n\nInside, the standard features are interesting, including the iDrive and the navigation system. But the interior layout leaves no doubt that the BMW engineers didn't care too much about the rear seats, where only children could sit. But if the rear wind deflector is installed, the rear seats are cut out of the question. \n\nEnginewise, BMW installed a range of gasoline and diesel engines, mated either with a 6-speed manual or an 8-speed automatic transmission. The most powerful version is the 6-cylinders M235i which offers 326 hp from a twin-scroll turbo gasoline engine. \n\nBut the 2 Series convertible is built for enjoying driving in the open air. So, with the windows up and the top down, the carmaker claims that the occupants can have a decent conversation without the need for yelling to each other. We think they it was about the front occupants."

    "model_description": "After almost one million units sold since 2011, BMW 1 Series received a well-awaited face-lift.The new, 2017 model received new colors and a wider range of alloy wheels. Engines are ranging from a very economical three cylinder to a powerful inline six, three liter badged as M140i. They are offering both petrol and diesel engines. The  power ranges between 109 HP on the 116i and 340 HP for M140i. \n\nThe main market for the 1 series is Europe, where the Bavarian manufacturer sold around 70% of its production. As expected, another big market for the premium compact size vehicle is China. It is the last model of 1 Series offered on a RWD platform. The next generation will receive a new FWD chassis, which will be shared with MINI. \n\nIn the tech-department, BMW brought the latest-generation iDrive infotainment system. For those who wants more, they are offering a Professional Navigation System with an 8.8 inch touchscreen. It can be controlled either by voice or through iDrive controller with touch-sensitive knob.\n\nThe advanced system offers Real Time Traffic Information (RTTI) which works together with the navigation system offering the shortest or fastest routes taking into account traffic-jams, accidents and other hazards on the road. The connectivity integration allows also up to ten devices on its on-board WiFi hotspot and Apple CarPlay."

    "model_description": "In 2015, the second generation of the 1 Series from BMW went through plastic surgery and some other technical updates.The final result for the 3-door compact hatchback from the German brand is now more appealing and could be ordered with the xDrive all-wheel-drive system.\n\nFor the 3-door, as well as for the 5-door version, BMW installed features like automatic climate control, rain sensor, BMW Radio Professional and the iDrive standard on all the range. The 6.5 inches color display is also standard and integrated into the dashboard. It doesn't look like it was installed by the dealers afterward.\n\nThe long doors of the 3-door version are as long as before, and the rear passengers will have to climb inside behind the front seats. Fortunately, the big wheelbase allows them to enter good enough.\n\nUnder the hood, there is a big range of powertrains, with manual or automatic transmissions. For the first time, the 1 Series can be equipped with the 8-speed Steptronic gearbox from the Japanese manufacturer Aisin.\nFive petrol and five diesel engines with BMW TwinPower Turbo technology are available for the 2015 BMW 1-Series. Setting the pace in terms of sports performance is the BMW M135i M with an inline-6 engine now producing 326 hp. The most fuel-efficient is the BMW 116d EfficientDynamics Edition, which combines 116 hp with low fuel consumption of 3.4 liters per 100 kilometers (69.1 mpg-US). Customers can also choose the all-wheel-drive system, BMW xDrive, for the BMW M135i, BMW 120d, and BMW 118d."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced the second generation of the 1 Series in 2012 and continued to be the smallest car with a rear-wheel-drive and an all-wheel-drive option.The first generation of the 1 Series was well received by the market in all of its shapes and number of doors (two, three, or five) and took its main competitor, Mercedes-Benz, by surprise. Then, after learning and listening to all the critics from its customers, BMW chose to change the pace and improved the 1 Series to a higher level.\n\nFrom the outside, the 1 Series three doors looked more like a hot-hatchback. Its cab-rearward design with a sloped-down rear window's top edge induced the image of a coupe. Well, it wasn't. But its big, swept-back headlights and the sculptured side panels gave the impression of one. In the back, the Kamm-back styling with a raked-forward windscreen and a small roof-spoiler improved the sporty image.\n\nInside, BMW increased the materials' quality and finishes. It offered plenty of storage areas in the center console, the center armrest, the door panels, and even under the steering-column. Its two bucket-seats at the front were mounted low. The carmaker used soft, spongy materials on the dashboard. Even though all the range received a standard infotainment unit, it wasn't available with a touch-screen. In the back, the 60/40 split-folding bench enlarged the trunk area with a completely flat surface.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW installed a very wide choice of engines, ranged between 101 hp and 320 hp paired with a six-speed manual or an eight-speed automatic. Some specific versions were available with all-wheel-drive."

BMW didn't do that for its well-known model and chose to update the 3-Series in 2015 and the GT version in 2016. But the sales figures were under expectations.\n\nFor the front area, the 3-Series GT received a new pair of headlights with LED for both low and high-beam. The round tubes o the lamps were encircled by daytime driving lights. Adaptive LED headlights were offered as an option. For the M Sport Package, the 3-Series GT was offered with a different front apron with large air intake, rear bumper with diffuser insert, and side sills. In the back, the taillights were redesigned and full-LEDs.\n\nInside, there were new materials, with higher quality. The Center Information Display received a flatter design and a narrow profile grille. On the center stack, the controls for the radio and air conditioning featured high-gloss black trim, and the radio and air conditioning controls were framed by chrome applications.\n\nUnder the hood, there was a new version available for the 325d Gran Turismo. New gasoline engines from the BMW EfficientDynamics family were introduced. The 2016 3-Series GT was available with rear- or all-wheel-drive for all the gasoline versions, while for the diesel versions, it was available for the 320d and 330d, and standard for the 335d."

    "model_description": "The new BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo adds an innovative new concept to the successful BMW 3 Series line-up.The third body variant in the current model family combines the Sedan\u2019s dynamic, sporting genes with the practicality and versatility of the Touring, qualities which are backed up by a palpable increase in space and driving comfort. The Gran Turismo exudes aesthetic and emotional appeal, boasts a distinctive presence on the road and offers similarly pronounced driving pleasure. All of which allows the new Gran Turismo to make a compelling case for itself as both an elegant business carriage and a dynamic, comfortable tourer. Typical BMW proportions, four doors with frameless windows, a coupe-style, gently downward-sloping roofline and a large, automatically opening and closing tailgate define the distinctive exterior character of the BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo. An active rear spoiler \u2013 the first of its type on a BMW \u2013 provides visual lightness and reduces lift at touring speeds. The new BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo is 200 millimetres longer in total than the BMW 3 Series Touring, comes with a 110-millimetre longer wheelbase and stands 81 millimetres taller. However, the clever use of proportions, surfaces and lines ensures that the BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo is immediately recognisable as a member\nof the new BMW 3 Series range."

    "model_description": "BMW has a long history of making roadsters all the way back to its roots.This is why it continued to make roadsters for driving pleasure. In 2018, the new generation of the Z4 was launched. Unlike the previous generation, which was available with a retractable hard-top, the new generation is available only as a roadster. Those who want a coupe will have to buy the 2018 Toyota Supra, which is almost identical but it has a fixed top.\n\nUnlike the Supra, the Z4 is available in three engine versions. The Z4 is available with a two liters engine either naturally aspirated or turbocharged, and the top version 3.0-liter turbocharged. The output range is between 197 and 340 hp. For the base model, the sDrive 2.0i, the transmission is a 6-speed manual gearbox. For all the others, an 8-speed Steptronic automatic gearbox is fitted as standard.\n\nCompared to the older version, it is bigger on the outside but has a shorter wheelbase. Now it features a 2.47 meters (97.2\u201d) long distance between the axles, which makes the car more agile in the corners. It also has a 50:50 weight distribution.\n\nFrom the technology point of view, the Z4 has some interesting features. Apart from the latest digital instrument cluster and infotainment, the Z4 can be opened and locked via smartphone. Using the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, the smartphone turns into a key. So, if you forgot your keys at home, just be sure you have the phone charged."

It was followed by the Z3 and the mighty Z8. In 2002, the first generation of the Z4 was launched. The second generation for the Z4 was introduced in 2009, followed by the LCI in 2013. The Z4 E89 was offered with the retractable hard-top and eliminated the coupe version, which was available on its predecessor.  After the 2013 model, all engine versions featured turbocharged units.\n\nFrom the outside, the striking view was at the front, where the headlights were fitted with LED instead of regular light bulbs. The Z4 was offered exclusively with a retractable hard-top, which helped the buyers who didn't want their canvas top sitting with other parts under the trunk lid.\n\nInside, the 2013 Z4 received high-gloss black surrounds for the central air vents and the iDrive control system's folding Control Display, which was offered as part of the optional navigation system. The BMW Z4 sDrive28i, BMW Z4 sDrive35i, and BMW Z4 sDrive35is were offered with Kansas leather trim.\n\nFor the 2013 model, BMW added the sDrive18i version, which used the 2.0-liter turbocharged engine. It was offered as standard with a 6-speed manual."

It produced no less than 306 hp and needed around 5.2 seconds to reach 100 kph.\n\nIf mated with the 7-speed dual clutch transmission, the Z4 was 0,1 seconds quicker thanks to the ultra quick uphisft and perfectly matched downshifts.\n\nAesthetically, the Z4 was a combination of a 6-Series Coupe (rear end) and a 3-Series (headlights). The Z4 featured the classic roadster proportions with a long hood, a short deck lid and a low wide stance.\n\nThe retractable metal top could be raised or lowered in 20 seconds and the Z4 was the first to come with a two-piece, electro-hydraulically operated hard-top.\n\nFor 2009, the overall visibility was greatly improved, with all round visibility up by 14% and side visibility up by 40%.\n\nAlthough a little bit pricy, the Z4 was well equipped, powerful and fun to drive. Other less expensive options on the market at that time were the Mazda MX-5 and the Nissan 370z."

The road was equipped with a manually operated soft top and a defroster-equipped glass rear window.\n\nSafety wise, the Z4 came with antilock disc brakes and a stability control system. Also, side airbags, active knee protection and rollover protection were included.\n\nWhile the Z4 earned a 3-star rating for side-impact, it managed to score 5 stars out of 5 for frontal impact.\n\nThe Z4 had a timeless design and sold well over the years."

    "model_description": "BMW built part of its reputation on roadsters such as the 328, 507 or Z1.That is one reason why the 2006 Z4 M Roadster was very important in the constructor's lineup.\n\nThe German car-maker decided to launch the whole pack of the Z4 when it was introduced at the Detroit Auto Show in 2006. The new car was available as a coupe or a roadster. It was the last generation of the Z4 that featured the distinct, two bodyworks.\n\nThe Z4 M Roadster shared some parts with other Z4 Roadsters, but not all of them. On the outside, there was a different front bumper with larger air intakes to cool the brakes and the engine. On the side, there was a new design for the front fenders. The same went with the rear, where the four exhausts were fitted as standard.\n\nInside, the new sport-bucket seats ensured its occupants that the car means business and they provided very good lateral support while fast cornering. The instrument cluster featured some M-specific badges.\n\nThe most important modifications for the car were underneath. The M-specific engine was a 3.2-liter that offered 330 hp. It was mated to a six-speed manual and an M-differential. Unlike the rest of the range, the M-version featured a hydraulic power steering."

    "model_description": "The BMW Z4 arrived in 2002 to replace the BMW Z3 introduced in 1995.At first, the Z4 was only available as a roadster, however, in 2006, the German producer launched the coupe version.\nThe Z4\u2019s body dimensions were larger and its wheelbase was longer and wider.  The suspension was also upgraded to be stiffer and the car was equipped with a sport package which firmed up the steering. Some of the Z4\u2019s elements were borrowed from the BMW\u2019s 3 series such as the multilink suspension which was more advanced than the one used for the BMW Z3.\nThe steering no longer used the hydraulic pump and was replaced by an electric servo motor \u2013 the steering was controlled based on suspension movement and speed. Some might say that the steering stopped being that precise due to this change.\nThe Roadster (also called E85) had either a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission.  The Coupe released in 2006 had a 6-speed manual or a 6-speed automatic, equipped with shift paddles mounted on the steering column.\nThe BMW Z4 was offered with gasoline engines only, in 7 different cubic capacities and different power. The M version of the Coupe and the Roadster had the engine used for the M3, a 3.2-liter developing 343 hp. The standard featured a 6-speed manual gearbox."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced the first full-electric version of the X1 model, named it iX1 in 2022, and increased its presence on the EV market.After trials and errors, BMW finally looked like it had learned how to do electric vehicles properly. But the carmaker knew that it needed more cars on the same platform to cover the development costs, so the iX1 shared many of its components with gasoline, diesel, hybrid, and plug-in hybrid models.\n\nOn the outside, the most significant changes made to the car to differentiate it from its IAC-powered cousins were the blue accents on various areas of the car located inside the side clusters on the lower bumper, the side sills, and the rear bumper. One important difference was on the grille that was completely shut. It looked more conventional than its bigger brother, the iX3. The car featured standard LED headlights or Adaptive LEDs as an option. At the back, the taillights sported the same L-shaped design pattern as the one found at the front.\n\nInside, BMW installed a screen in front of the driver for the instrument panel and a touch-screen atop the center stack for the iDrive infotainment unit based on the BMW Operating System 8. They were covered by the same curved glass, creating the so-called BMW Curved Display. The raised seating position allowed enough room for up to five passengers to comfortably sit inside the cabin.\n\nBut the most important difference between the iX1 and the rest of the X1 range was under the skin. BMW installed two electric motors that provided a total output of 230 kW (308 PS) and 494 Nm (364 lb-ft) of torque. The standard version came with an 11 kW AC charging port, while a 22 kW version was available as an option."

    "model_description": "Developed just in time to snatch some sales from the second-generation Mercedes-Benz CLA, the BMW 2-Series Gran Coupe is the first of its kind on the Bavarian lineup.Just like the CLA, which is its only direct rival, the 2-Series Gran Coupe is marketed as a four-door coupe, a sportier alternative to the more classically-styled BMW 1 Series Sedan. It's not the first compact BMW to be available in the United States, but it will be the cheapest not-counting its M-Performance version.\n\nDespite being exclusively built in Leipzig, Germany, almost 20 percent of all cars built will find their way into the U.S. after the 2-Series Gran Coupe has its world premiere and the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show. Based on the UKL2 front-wheel-drive architecture, which BMW initially developed for its MINI lineup, the model is focusing most of its credentials on design features. Just like the Mercedes-Benz CLA, the doors feature frameless windows and the roof is a lot more sloped towards the rear compared to a regular sedan, such as the 1 Series. This translates into a sportier shape but slightly lower headroom, especially for the rear passengers. The 2-Series Gran Coupe will be available with both front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive, with the top engine versions being offered strictly with AWD."

    "model_description": "BMW started the 2022 year in full blast by launching a refreshed lineup for the 8-Series in all shapes and sizes, and the Gran Coupe in the M-Spec version also received an upgrade.While those oriented on speed and handling were more biased on purchasing the coupe version, there was a big market for high-performance four-door vehicles. That's why BMW and Mercedes-Benz brought back the four-door coupe styling initiated back in the '60s by the Mark III Rover P5.\n\nThe M8 Gran Coupe shares its underpinning with its two-door, hard-top sibling, the M8. Yet, it boasts a longer wheelbase and could accommodate two passengers in the back. Like its sibling, it featured frame-less door windows, making it look sportier, but the B-pillar had to stay in place. At the front, the Gran Coupe offered the same front fascia as the non-facelifted version, with a wide, trapezoidal air intake on the lower apron flanked by two functional scoops that cooled the brakes.\n\nInside, the most noticeable change was for the infotainment system, which received a 12.3\" touchscreen instead of the former 10.25\" one. There was also new hardware for it, allowing better integration with the smartphone. In addition, customers had the option to order it with either standard bucket seats or, as an option, carbon-fiber sport seats that enhanced the sporty character. The M8 Gran Coupe featured a split-folding bench fit for two at the back since there was a tall transmission tunnel that crossed the car from front to back.\n\nUnder the hood, the Bavarian carmaker placed the same powerplant as the M8 Coupe mated to an eight-speed automatic gearbox that sent the power in all corners."

    "model_description": "BMW raised the electric vehicles' standards and showed the electric-car industry how a proper sports sedan should be built when it introduced the i4 in 2021.While Tesla was getting more attention than anyone else when it came to electric vehicles, BMW was in its lab working on a new car. Its engineers were not concerned about what other carmakers could achieve and how fast they could reach the 60-mile mark (92 kph) from standing still. With a huge experience in car building and intensive testings for the powertrain, it delivered the i4.\n\nIt used the same platform as the 4 Series to cut its costs, and it showed the same tall grille considered by some as \"Bugs Bunny teeth\" while others remembered that BMW wore the tall and narrow kidney-grille since the 30's. Its angular LED headlights and the wide black area in the front apron revealed an aggressive, sporty styling. From its sides, the four-door fastback styling resembled the X4 look, but in street clothes and lower ground clearance.\n\nInside, the carmaker made the decisive step toward the digital revolution and deleted all analog instruments inside the cabin. The instrument panel and the touch-screen for the infotainment unit shared the same long panel spread across 60% of the dashboard. But the carmaker didn't delete some physical buttons and controls.\n\nFor the powertrain, BMW charged with an all-wheel-drive electric system that provided 530 hp. Thus, it allowed the new i4 to beat the 0 to 60 mph (0-92 kph) time in less than four seconds. The carmaker promised more than 300 miles (482 km) according to the EPA tests or around 350 miles (590 km) in WLTP European tests."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced the first station wagon version for its top-performer 3 Series, the M3, at the Goodwood Festival of Speed 2022, aiming at those drivers who still asked for speed even after their families grew.BMW was not at its first try to sell a station wagon based on an M-badged vehicle. It did that for the first time with the M5 Touring in 1992, but with limited success. \n\nSharing the same front fascia with its sedan sibling, the M3 Touring showed the same tall kidney-grille, albeit some called those nostrils. It was a love or hate affair for the BMW, but nevertheless very discussed worldwide. The lower bumper featured an air-intake for the engine and two side scoops to cool the brakes and divert the airflow around the bodywork. From its profile, the M3 Touring revealed its long roof ended with a small and curved roof spoiler. At the back, the quad-exhaust system and the diffuser kept the same look as the sedan, but the bumper featured a lower cut for the tailgate.\n\nInside, the curved display and the front seats were carried over from the M3 sedan. At the back, up to three passengers could sit on the split-folding bench that could expand the trunk area from 500 liters (17.65 cu-ft) to a respectable 1,510 liters (53.3 cu-ft). But, due to the transmission tunnel that crossed the car from front to back, it was difficult to place a third person in the middle.\n\nUnder the hood, the carmaker installed the same inline-six, fitted with BMW's TwinPower Turbo technology powerplant that provided 503 PS (510 hp). It was paired to an eight-speed automatic gearbox and sent the power in all corners."

    "model_description": "The M4 CS was built only two years and it sat between the M4 with Competition Package and the M4 GTS.It was the best balance between a race-focused and a road car.\n\nWhile some other car manufacturers are building either a performance car or a track-ready vehicle, BMW decided to go mid-road with the CS. It took some parts from the M4 Competition and some parts from the GTS. After the mix was done, it added some specific features.\n\nOn the outside, at the front, there was a lip-spoiler at the bottom of the apron. It was made out of carbon-fiber but it was fixed, while the GTS had it adjustable. The hood was made out of carbon-fiber as well as the one found on the GTS. In the back, the CS featured a specific lip on the trunk. For the wheels, the car was fitted with 19\u201d light-alloy wheels in the front and 20\u201d wheels in the back, equipped with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires.\n\nInside, there was a mix of race-inspired features and comfort. The door panels and the seats were carried-over the GTS. The suspension was taken from the Competition model. The infotainment system was similar to the one in the regular M4.\n\nUnder the hood, there was the same inline-six unit with two turbochargers that offered more power than the M4 Competition Package. It was fitted to a standard 7-speed automatic (dual-clutch) gearbox, and that was the only transmission available."

    "model_description": "Based on the same platform as the MINI Countryman, the BMW X2 was the smallest Sports Activity Coupe from the German stable.It was the coupe version for the X1 SUV.\n\nThe crossover market was the next to grow fast after the SUV segment. BMW decided to act in that segment as well, introducing the first generation of the X1 in 2008, followed by the second generation in 2015. For the 2015 generation, the management decided to build a sporty version as well.\n\nEven though the X2 was the sporty version of the X1, it didn't have any exterior panels shared with its sibling. There was a new front fascia, with a taller bumper and narrower headlights. From the side, the car looked more like a hatchback with higher ground clearance. It was the only BMW in the modern era to feature the company logo on the D-pillars.\n\nInside, the X2 was good for four adults, but the rear seats were not so spacious as in the X1. Since the car was built on a front-wheel-drive platform, it offered more interior legroom for all passengers, but not too much headroom for the rear ones due to the sloped roofline. The dashboard featured a floating infotainment screen on top of the center stack. The instrument cluster featured two round dials and a TFT screen for additional information. The trunk was smaller, but it featured an underfloor additional storage area.\n\nThe X1 was fitted with diesel, gasoline, and hybrid engines. Depending on the option, they were mated as standard to a 6-speed manual or with an automatic transmission. It was offered with front or all-wheel-drive systems."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced a life-cycle impulse for the X4 M Competition, and, as usual, it offered better performances and improved technologies to help the driver.There were times when the cars that could do a 0 to 60 mph run (0-97 kph) in under four seconds were supercars. It was the league of Ferrari F430 Challenge, Lamborghini Gallardo, or Porsche GT2. Yet, in 2021, BMW introduced the X4 M Competition, which could do the same in a daily-driver four-door SUV.\n\nWhen BMW introduced the facelifted version of the X3 and X4 in 2021, it also launched the M Competition models. For the X4 M, that was reflected in the car's look. At the front, it featured standard narrower headlights with adaptive LED with MATRIX function. A completely new black kidney grille with black vertical slats created a stronger image for the fastest X4 on sale at that time. At the sides, the exhaust vent behind the front wheels and the body-colored side sills were carried over from its predecessor, the X4 M. The rear bumper sported a new design with a piano-black apron that incorporated broader cuts for the free-floating pipes.\n\nInside, there were two main areas changed. The carmaker introduced a new design for the center console, including a new gear-selector. A set of carbon-fiber trims adorned the center side of the dashboard and the door panels. BMW also introduced the Driving Assistant Professional as a standard feature, which trained the driver to better use the car either on track mode or on regular driving.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW upgraded the 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six from the X4M with a crankshaft carried over from the M4. Thus, it could increase the power and, as a result, it dropped the 0-62 mph run to 3.9 seconds."

    "model_description": "The latest SAC from BMW has finally received a proper M badge.From the look to the wheels, some can say that this is a real M vehicle, not just a sport-package. Despite some rumors, the 2019 X4M doesn't use the same inline-six engine from the M3/M4, but a new straight-six engine, which will make its way on the future M3 and M4. \n\nThe new 3.0-liter unit, twin-turbocharged, is the most powerful six-cylinder engine built by BMW. It offers 480 hp and 600 Nm (442 lb-ft) of torque for the X4M and 510 hp for the X4 M Competition. The 8-speed automatic transmission sends the power to the all four wheels via a version of the M xDrive all-wheel-drive system, which made its debut in the 2018 BMW M5. Performances are on top of its game with a 0 to 100 kph (62 mph) in 4.2 seconds, while the X4 M Competition can do the same sprint in just 4.1 seconds. \n\nThe look of the new X4 M is enhanced with a new design for the front bumper, with larger air-scoops and an apron. Some other aerodynamic details are visible on the car and are completed with the new, optional, 20\u201d  M light-alloy wheels. \n\nOn the inside, there are M Sport seats with extended Merino leather upholstery and specific door sill plates. The Competition model may be ordered with special bi-color leather and Alcantara applications."

    "model_description": "After a few years of innovations and experiments in electric mobility, BMW made another step and introduced the full-electric crossover iX3 in July 2020.The BMW i3 made part of its fans angry and the other ones happy. But the car sold well, and it allowed the German car-maker to understand the way people are using an electric vehicle. Meanwhile, the i3 provided valuable data for further developments of the electric mobility solution. And the first result of that experience was named iX3.\n\nIts look might resemble the BMW X3, and there was no coincidence since the well-known SUV was used as a base product for the electric vehicle. While the kidney-grille was more of a kidney-panel, since it was closed, the look was similar. There were only a few clues left from the profile, like the charging port door on the front fender. In the back, where the exhausts were placed on the X3, there were two blue trims.\n\nInside, the instrument cluster featured a TFT display. The infotainment system was placed on top of the center stack on the dashboard in a floating design trend. The gear-selector was similar to the one found in an X3. By moving the selector from \u201cD\u201d to \u201cB,\u201d the car used the regenerative braking system to slow the vehicle, charging the batteries. Bucket seats were installed for the front occupants, and a two-passengers profiled rear bench was installed, but there was room for up to five people inside.\n\nThe drivetrain used an electric motor to power the rear wheels only. The axle was specially developed and adapted for the existing X3 platform. All of the components were developed in-house by BMW, including the motor and the batteries. The 286 hp motor produced exactly the same output as the former BMW X3 3.0 SD."

    "model_description": "The first of its kind in the BMW 8 series range and for BMW in general, the all-new 8 Series Gran Coupe's debut was littered with \"sports car\" references, with the Bavarians being absolutely positive regarding the model's DNA.The striking model is also the only four-door version of the 8 Series, which was only available as either a two-door coupe or a two-door convertible until the Gran Coupe.\n\nThe four-door model has a 3,023 mm wheelbase - an increase of 201 millimeters over the BMW 8-Series Coupe - and measures 5,082 millimeters in length (+ 231 mm), 1,932 millimeters in width (+ 30 mm) and 1,407 millimeters in height (+ 61 mm). The front track width of 1,627 mm is the same as on the two-door, while the rear track of 1,671 millimeters is 28 mm wider, making it the widest car in the BMW lineup. Engine wise, the 8 Series Gran Coupe was launched with four different versions, including a diesel model, but it's possible that it will include more once the production ramps up. An M8 Gran Coupe is also in the cards, and is set to become the fastest four-door model that BMW has ever produced."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced a facelift for the X3's third generation in 2021, and, along with the rest of the range, it unveiled the life-cycle impulse for the X3 M.The X3 appeared on the market in 2003 as a compact SUV. While customers did not appreciate its Chris Bagle design styling, the vehicle's qualities convinced them. So, from the third generation, the German carmaker introduced a much-waited M version. At first, it was just the M 4.0i package from 2018, and then, the full M-version stormed the Autobahn with its 480 horses under the hood. \n\nThe design team knew that it could do a better job for the 2017 X3. So, the compact SUV received an M Competition package that included a new front fascia with narrower headlights by 10 mm (0.4\"), like the rest of the 2021 X3s. As an option, they could feature an adaptive LED with MATRIX function. Its grille was piano-black with vertical slats, which matched the apron's look. At the back, the X3 M Competition featured new LED taillights with a unique design and a diffuser under the bumper.\n\nBMW change the X3 M's interior with a new redesigned center console. It sported a new gear-selector, the i-Drive dial, and buttons. Above the center stack, the carmaker placed a 12\", wide-format touch-screen for the infotainment unit. The most significant change was on the digital instrument panel, which featured the Driving Assistant Professional as standard, which trained the driver. In addition, the new system allowed integration with Amazon Alexa via the My BMW app.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW upgraded the 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-six from the X3 M with a crankshaft carried over from the M4. Thus, it could increase the power and, as a result, it dropped the 0-62 mph run to 3.8 seconds."

    "model_description": "The first ever Motorsport Technik version of the BMW X3 took a while to get to market, but when it finally did almost no one was disappointed.Despite earlier rumors, the 2019 X3M and its \"four-door coupe/SUV\" brother, the X4 M, don't use the same engine as the F80 M3/M4, but a new straight-six that will also find its way under the next-generation M3 and M4.\n\nAvailable with two power outputs, the new 3.0-liter, twin-turbocharged straight-six is the most powerful production six-cylinder that BMW has ever made. In the regular X3 M it delivers 480 horsepower and 600 Nm (442 lb-ft) of torque, while the BMW X3 M Competition raises the output figure to 510 horsepower. \n\nA version of the M xDrive all-wheel-drive system, which made its debut in the 2018 BMW M5, sends the power to all four wheels via an 8-speed automatic transmission from ZF. The regular X3 M can go from 0 to 100 kph (62 mph) in 4.2 seconds, while the X3 M Competition can do the same sprint in just 4.1 seconds. \n\nOutside details will be noticed on the X3M, in form of High-gloss Black for the kidney grille surround, exterior mirror caps and M gills. The standard equipment includes 21\u201d M light-alloy wheels. \n\nOn the inside, there are M Sport seats with extended Merino leather upholstery and specific door sill plates. The Competition model may be ordered with special bi-color leather and Alcantara applications."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced the 1 Series Sedan for China and made a true contender for the Mercedes-Benz's CLA on the local market.While in the U.S. and Europe the Mercedes-Benz CLA was the only contender in the small-class premium segment, the BMW considered that it might be a good idea to challenge their traditional competitors only in China. The reason behind that decision was the half-of-million car sold in 2016 over there. Dr. Ian Robertson, BMW AG Management Board member responsible for Sales and Marketing BMW, stated that the Chinese customers asked for smaller vehicles, which were suited better in heavy traffic.\n\nThanks to its front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, the carmaker was able to make the 1 Series sedan short but with a mid-size segment wheelbase. At the front, the aggressive look of the angled headlights and the wide \"kidney-grille\" were specific for the Bavarese brand. Its fluid lines, with curved and sculptured door panels, offered the same image of a bigger car, but in a smaller package. The 1 Series sedan featured a 3-Series style for the taillights and a tall trunk in the back. Depending on the engine version, it sported one or two exhausts at the bottom of the rear apron.\n\nInside, the carmaker used the same parts and bits offered in the 1-Series hatchback. Its black dashboard with soft materials and the floating-type touch-screen above the center stack looked familiar for the entire BMW range from those times. Depending on the customer options and engine version, the carmaker offered a pair of standard bucket seats or sports seats, with cloth or leather upholstery. The bench was 40/20/40 split-folding, allowing the user to expand the trunk area.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW installed a choice of three engines range between 136 hp and 231 hp. All versions were paired to automatic transmissions."

    "model_description": "BMW came late to the electric-SUV revolution, but it didn't come empty-handed.It brought a vehicle that could match, and overtake, most of its competition.\n\nWhen Tesla stormed the automotive industry with the Roadster, there were just a few to see the revolution that was about to happen. As the electric car interest started to rise, the big carmakers began to research and develop new products. BMW's first strike was the i3, and it announced that the BMW-i would become a separate, electric, brand. In 2020, it showed its next product, the iX.\n\nLove-it or hate-it! That was what BMW might have said when it showed the vehicle with the massive grille at the front. The big kidneys were useless, apart from the aesthetic purpose. The narrow LED headlights formed a frontal fascia that resembled one of the Transformers robots. The overall shape resembled other X-models from the German carmaker's lineup.\n\nInside, BMW installed a futuristic, sloped dashboard, which inspired more of a concept-car than a production vehicle. The curving, one-piece display served as the central control element reinterpreting BMW cockpits' traditional driver-centric design. That was made by bringing together the 12.3-inch Information Display and the Control Display with its screen diagonal of 14.9 inches to form a single unit angled towards the driver. The front seats featured integrated headrests for more comfort for their occupants. In the back, a 40:20:40 bench with a three-way split-folding seatback was installed to increase the trunk area.\n\nBMW powered the iX with 500 hp electric motors that. The big battery pack installed inside the floor offered a 600 km (372 miles) range."

    "model_description": "The iX M60 heralds a new era for M since it is the first vehicle designed and engineered by the BMW M automobile as a purely electric vehicle right from the start.The M department started its journey half a century ago, and most of its products were based on regular BMW cars. It was just a matter of time until it started to improve the overall performances of the carmaker's crossovers, named SAV \u2013 or Sport Activity Vehicles. The well-known X5 was the first to receive such a treatment. But this time, it all began with a blank sheet of paper.\n\nWith all the evolution toward crossovers and SUVs on the market and the electric-car revolution started, it was just normal that BMW M would start making one. The iX M60 was unveiled at the beginning of 2022 and offered the highest torque available for an M-powered vehicle in history.\n\nThe design kept the same controversial front fascia with the vertical kidney-grille in the middle. Its length was comparable to an X5 and the width to an X7, while the height was lower than any of them. Its roofline resembled the X6, but it was not that much sloped as on its sibling. Despite its massive appearance, the car was actually light thanks to the extensive use of CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic) integrated into the safety cell, roof, and pillars.\n\nInside, thanks to the lack of transmission tunnel, the carmaker was able to create more legroom and add more storage areas. Its seats were multicontour, designed for comfort, but also with high bolstered areas for increased support during high-speed cornering. Like other BMWs from its time, it sported the BMW Operating System 8 for the iDrive. A wide and curved display sat on the dashboard, as a floating glass panel, integrating the instrument cluster and the touch-screen for the infotainment unit."

    "model_description": "The all new cabriolet was revealed in September 2007 as a four-seat convertible with a soft-top roof.The full production started in 2008.\n\nThe BMW Series 1, also called the E88 was a rear-wheel drive car, offering a choice of four petrol and one diesel engines.\n\nThe convertible was based on the already released coupe, however, it was 12mm lower even if the length, width and the wheelbase length remained unchanged.\nThe soft-top roof could be operated at speeds up to 40 km/h and took 22 seconds to open or close, a bit slower than other cars in the same range, like the Audi A3.\nThe car was equipped with dual front and front seat-mounted side airbags, ABS, brake assist, ESC, corner braking control, traction control and other systems that made the BMW 1 Series a pretty safe car.\n\nThe climate control on this car used an intelligent system that recognized whether the roof is down and adjusted the airflow accordingly. The leather trim was using a Sun Reflective technology that reduced the surface temperature of the seats by 20 degrees.\n\nEven if BMW marketed the convertible as a 4-seater, the rear seats did not offer the passengers enough leg room, thus it was more adequate for kids. The trunk space though offered 260 liters, enough for a trip in the weekend."

    "model_description": "After years of hesitations and \u201cnot now\u201d moments, BMW took the gamble and launched a smaller coupe than the 3-Series.And the result was a pocket-rocket rear-wheel-drive.\n\nThe 1 Series hatchback was on the market since 2004 and, when the BMW decided to launch the 3-door and the coupe in 2007, it was based on the 5-door success. But it was just a few months before the world economic crisis. But considering that the 1 Series accounted for about 20% of the BMW global sales in 2008.\n\nThe unusual shape of the vehicle was designed by Chris Bangle, the same designer that made the ugliest 7-Series ever. But for the size of the 1-Series, its theories worked just fine and the 1 Series Coupe was a good looking car for its era. Even though it had some unusual shape for the headlights for a BMW, the overall shape was right and the proportions were according to the 1970s BMW 1600. \n\nInside, the dashboard was simple and it had a retractable screen for the i-Drive infotainment system that could have been controlled via a rotary knob on the central console. \n\nA wide range of engines was available for the 1 Series coupe. The standard transmission was a 6-speed manual, while a 6-speed automatic was offered as an option."

    "model_description": "BMW gracefully avoided naming the M version of the 1 Series as an M1 since that could have triggered outrage from the fans and introduced the 1 Series M Coupe as the top-performance version in the model's lineup.When BMW introduced the 1 Series on the market as a more affordable sporty, RWD vehicle, many people saw it as the rightful successor of the E30 3-Series. As expected, the German carmaker offered its smallest model in the lineup with an M treatment.\n\nWith its more aggressive stance, the 1 Series M featured a new front bumper that sported a lower apron with a chin, a broad center grille, and two side scoops. These were not just aesthetic upgrades but functional as well, helping to cool the engine and the brakes. BMW installed enlarged fenders to cover the wider wheels and tires. In addition, a pair of functional vents were added behind the wheel-wells to extract the air and decrease the aerodynamic uplift of the front. The two-door only 1 Series M featured a lip spoiler on the trunk and a completely new rear bumper in the back. A quad-exhaust system was installed to visually confirm the sport-oriented vehicle and the inline-six breathing abilities.\n\nInside, the carmaker installed bucket seats with high-bolstered areas for the front occupants. At the same time, the rear bench could hardly host two occupants in the back. Moreover, since it was designed for performance, the 1 Series M was not offered with a sunroof, thus increasing the headroom and allowing for helmet use.\n\nUnder the hood, the 1 Series M hosted a 3.0-liter inline-six engine. Helped by a pair of turbochargers, it developed 335 hp (340 PS) and could rocket the car from 0 to 62 mph (0-100 kph) in less than five seconds."

    "model_description": "In 1966, after two years of the introduction of the \u201cNew Class Sedan\u201d in the BMW lineup, a more affordable version was unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show: the 1600-2 coupe.While it was known mostly as 1600, the -2 characters meant that the car featured two doors. Even if the general design concept was similar to the bigger brother 1600, it featured a different style. The lead designer was Wilhelm Hofmeister, the man responsible for that particular shape of the C-pillars in all the BMW vehicles since the mid-'60s. A Baur cabriolet version was offered to the market and in 1971 a so-called Touring version in the form of a three-door hatchback was on the sales list. The Touring was produced only a year due to its very low sales.\n\nWith a low height, a balanced design, and a tall greenhouse, the 1600 coupe was light, nimble and affordable. Its two round headlights were standard but some versions were offered with four round headlights. The interior was cramped for four occupants but offered enough room for two in the front.\n\nThe engine was taken from the 1600 model with four doors, but with a different carburetor. It was mated to a 4-speed manual gearbox. It offered only 96 hp. A year later, a new version was introduced: the 1600 TI that offered 110 hp. It was a revelation for the light, 960 kg (2,116 lbs) car. A 3-speed automatic was offered as an option. For some markets, the little 1600 received a 2.0-liter engine since 1971"

    "model_description": "BMW introduced the 4-door 1500 sedan at the 1961 Frankfurt Motor Show.This brand new model featured a quite innovative design and, added with its excellent suspension and powerplant ratings, became the German manufacturer's best-sold model at the time (also saving the company from bankruptcy). The 1500 brought BMW worldwide recognition and was sold with 9500 marks, around 4.800 EUR, but definitely had a greater value in the \u201860s.\n\nThe German producer felt the need to design a medium sized car, however, money was not enough at that time, until the 1959 when they started to design the 1500 model.The BMW 1500 later served as a base model for the more powerful 1800ti and 1600ti models, together with their derivative versions. Its C-pillar featured an innovative 'Hofmeister kink' design, meaning a low-forward bend separating the rear window from the rear glass. Its 4-cylinder 1.5-liter unit was able to deliver around 80 hp and was later redeveloped for the 1800 and 1600 models.\n\nThe BMW 1500 could go up to 150 km/h and delivered excellent performances compared to its competitors. The car rocketed to 100 km/h in 12.6 seconds. The interior was designed in such a way to provide both functionality and a clean, sophisticated look. \nThe BMW 1500 was appraised for its all-round visibility, sportiness and luggage space, although the first models were developing some issues like the separation of the semi-trailing arm mounts from the body and rear axle failures. All in all, the car offered both comfort and reliability.\nIn 1972, the 1500 was discontinued and BMW unveiled the 5 series."

Due to intense criticism, this features was dropped on all production models after the official release. \n\nThe car was fitted with a 2.0L KKK (Kuhnle, Kopp and Kausch) turbocharged engine delivering an impressive 170 hp and 173 lb-ft of torque. Car's on road performances were also impressive, resulting in a 7-second score on the 0-60 mph sprint and a top speed of 130 mph. It was the first European turbocharged production model in history. Its discontinuance in 1974 was caused by the famous '70\u2019s Oil Crisis' (only 1672 units were assembled)."

    "model_description": "With its light weight, nimble handling, and rock-solid reliability, the BMW 2002 was one of the key elements for the BMW brand in the 1960s.And it was the original predecessor of the BMW 3 Series, back in 1968.\n\nIn 1968, the Boeing 747 took off for its first flight and the Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit the moon. In the same year, BMW launched the 2002 model. It was an evolution of the BMW 1600-2 model, based on a shortened platform of the \u201cNew Class Sedans\u201d. The \u201c-2\u201d meant it was a two-door vehicle. The 2002 received its name due to a two-liter engine and a two-door bodywork.\n\nThe car had a simple design, with a three-box body. The hood and the trunk lid looked like they were floating on top of the side panels. It wasn't a mistake in design, but a unique method to gather attention and it worked. The very thin pillars of the car ensured a very good all-around visibility.\n\nInside, there was nothing special. Not even a stereo, but in 1969, as a favor for the American market, it introduced a 3-speed automatic gearbox. The flat seats were arguably comfortable. A thick steering wheel was installed to compensate for the lack of power-steering. There was no AC in the car, just the wide-open windows provided fresh air.\n\nThe 2002 featured a 100 hp engine, good enough to make the light, 960 kg (2116 lbs) car move quick around the corners. A more powerful version, the Tii, was introduced in 1971 and it was available with a choice of a 4- or 5-speed manual gearbox."

    "model_description": "BMW launched the 2800 CS model in 1968.Designed by Alex von Falkenhausen, this 2-door coupe addressed the sporty-type of drivers and was used by the German manufacturer as inspiration for several racing models throughout the late '60s. This Coupe Sport version featured a redesigned front end and a one-of-a-kind C-pillar while fitted with a 170-hp 2.8L SOHC 6-cylinder engine. This unit was mated to either a 4-speed manual transmission or a 3-speed ZF automatic gearbox. Three years after its launch, the 2800 Coupe Sport was replaced by the 3.0 CS, still based on the E9 automobile platform but receiving a larger 3.0L engine."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced the fourth generation 3 Series Cabriolet in the spring of 2007.The biggest novelty about this model was the three-piece electronically-operated retractable hard-top (revolutionary new device within the BMW range) and enlarged rear & side windows for better visibility. Another innovation developed by BMW and fitted into this latest generation Cabriolet consisted of a Sun-Reflective Technology leather upholstery. The 3 Series Cabriolet was based on BMW's new E93 automobile platform and initially came with a choice of 325i and 335i variants. Later on, the model received several small engines for a wider range to choose from. The top-of-the-range 335i model benefited from a 3.0L twin-turbocharged unit delivering 307 hp that was mated to a standard 6-speed manual transmission (6-speed automatic with steering-wheel-mounted shifting paddles was also available as an optional feature). Car's on-road performances were very impressive too, with a 5.8-second score on the 0-60 mph sprint and an electronically-limited speed of 155 mph."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced an LCI for the E46 series in 2003, and the drop-top version was also affected by the new upgrades, which added not only a slightly different look but also better drivetrains and technologies.The Bavarian carmaker was on top of its game with the 3 Series convertible. It was, basically, alone in the segment. It had a weak competitor in the Volvo C70 and the Merc's CLK. The latter was a mixture of the C-Class platform, which was the rightful opponent for the 3 Series, and the E-Class look, which aimed at the 5 Series. \n\nAt the front, the headlights received a new treatment with smoother lines and redesigned lower bumper. The versions with foglamps sported them in separate, triangular-shaped clusters on the outer side of the lower apron. At the back, the car got new taillights that sported a white area on their upper side for the turn signals. In addition, the bumper was restyled and featured a lower apron. Moreover, the carmaker offered an M-Packet that gave the car an aggressive look.\n\nThe cabin was as spacious as before since the carmaker was limited to the same wheelbase. But it enhanced the front seats with an option for high-bolstered ones. A navigation system became available on the options list. Also, in the tech department, the car got parking sensors.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW dropped the 2.0-liter inline-six powerplant and replaced it with a new, 2.2-liter unit. The base model, on the other hand, sported a 2.0-liter unit from an inline-four. In those years, the turbo-diesel engines were praised for their performance and fuel efficiency, so BMW included two oil-burners on the convertible, and they were fast enough to convince people to buy it."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced the third generation of the 3 Series in 1990 and made it available in more shapes and sizes than before, but it delayed the introduction of the drop-top version until 1993.It might be said that BMW was somehow surprised by customers' demands for a premium convertible, and that's why it delayed it. Whatever the reasons, in 1993, the German carmaker brought it to the market, and the result was far beyond expectations.\n\nThe drop-top version was clearly inspired by the E36's coupe, with which it shared the front fascia and part of the body panels. Its squared-looking headlights were in total opposition with the quad-round headlamp design of its predecessor, the E30. At the back, the carmaker extended the taillights on the trunk lid but took care to keep the brake lights only on the quarter panel. From its sides, the lack of the B-pillar made the car look more like a roadster than a four-door convertible.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, the E30 cabriolet, the E36 offered more room in the back for a couple of passengers, even though they had to be careful with their feet since the legroom was not that ample. For short trips, though, it was fine. At the front, depending on the options, the carmaker placed regular bucket seats or high-bolstered ones for sportier versions. But still, the carmaker didn't offer the option of a power-operated roof.\n\nUnder the hood, the carmaker installed a sluggish 1.8-liter powerplant for the base version but compensated with the rest of the range. Moreover, a five-speed automatic was available and contributed to the sports factor."

    "model_description": "BMW unveiled an open-top version for its successful 3-Series in 1986, four years after the model's second generation.The German carmaker was not at its first open-top 3-Series, but unlike the E21 3-Series, it was fully convertible. Its predecessor was only a top-cabriolet produced by Karroserie Baur had the side windows, B-pillars, and C-pillars kept in place. With the 3-Series Cabriolet, BMW entered the world of accessible, daily-driver convertibles.\n\nIts front fascia was similar to the rest of the range, featuring double headlights and a black grille at the front. Its wrapped-around, front plastic bumper featured a lower apron for the fog lights, offered as an option, and a small lip underneath. Its straight lines and slightly flared wheel-arches made it a timeless classic, proving the value of its minimalist design.\n\nInside, the car carried over the interior from a 3-series coupe. Its driver-oriented dashboard featured a tilted center stack and the angular-shaped instrument cluster. On the base trim level, the car sported a cloth interior, but BMW offered a leather upholstery. Despite its short wheelbase, its rear seats were usable but with limited legroom. The tall transmission tunnel prevented a third person in the back, and the carmaker advertised the car as a four-seat vehicle. The 3-Series Cabriolet offered a decent trunk size for a long journey or a short holiday, even with the top down.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW installed a choice of three engines ranged between a four-banger 1.8-liter and a 2.5-liter inline-six. All versions were available with either a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic."

    "model_description": "To attract more customers on its side, BMW introduced the 3-Series compact in 1993.The second and last generation was introduced in 2000. It didn't work too well.\n\nWhile the first generation of the 3-Series Compact was based on the E30 platform, the second generation was based on the E46 platform, which was a way better technical solution. The idea was to build a cheaper BMW, so the young customers will be attracted by the brand and then stick to it. The same thing did Mercedes-Benz with the C-Class Sport Coupe in 2001. And they failed as well.\n\nFor the second generation, BMW chose a different front fascia than the regular E46 3-Series. The rounded headlights in the middle and the wider one on the outer side, looked like they were separated, but they were in the same headlight unit. The 3-door bodywork featured the same front doors as the 3-Series Coupe. The rear quarter panels were different since the car was shorter. Instead of a windscreen in the back and a separate trunk-lid, the Compact version featured a tailgate.\n\nInside, the car was similar to the 3-Series E46 coupe, with the same interior room. Despite the long, 2.75 m (107.3\u201d) wheelbase, since the engine was placed longitudinal, the front seats were pushed rearward. The dashboard was the same as the one found in the regular E46.\n\nFor the engine side, the 3-Series Compact was available with a choice of gasoline, and diesel engines ranged between 1.6-liter and 2.5-liter. A 2.0-liter diesel unit also was available. The biggest flaw of the car was the design and the light rear end, which tend the car to oversteer too often."

    "model_description": "Before 1994, the last time when BMW offered a hatchback was between 1971 and 1972 with the Touring version of the 1600 series.And it was not a success. But for the 1994 model, it was a different story.\n\nIn 1994 there was no premium hatchback on the market, but the hatchbacks market share in the compact segment was big. So, BMW tried the market with a car that was based upon two different 3-Series models on a 3-door hatchback bodywork.\n\nThe first generation of the 3-Series compact was launched in 1994 to get the premium customers from the hatchback segment. The front of the car was identical to the BMW 3-series from the third generation (E36). But from there on, it was a mix of new and old parts. The rear suspension was taken from the second 3-Series generation (the E30). The doors were different than the rest of the E36 range, even though they looked the same. The rear windows were hinged in the front so they could open a little. The tailgate and the rear end were different than any other BMW vehicle of those days.\n\nThe interior featured a dashboard inspired by the E30 and with some parts taken from that generation. The front seats were from the E36 coupe and the rear seats could have been folded in a split 60/40 manner.\n\nUnder the bodywork, there was an E36 front suspension and an E30 rear suspension. It featured only fuel-injected engines, with displacements that varied from a small, 1.6-liter unit to the top-of-the-range 2.5-liter inline-six unit. It was available with a standard 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic."

    "model_description": "The 3 Series Coupe was launched in 2006, a year after the four-door version.That was not something unusual, but the completely different styling, when compared to its sedan sibling, was a shock for the brand's fans.\n\nThe first 3 series was launched in 1975 and it was available as a two-door only. The first sedan appeared in 1983, a year after the second generation was launched, as a coupe. In 2005, the fifth generation was first launched as a sedan and, a year later, as a coupe. The German car-manufacturer succeeded to bring all the good features from the sedan version but added an individual identity of its own for the coupe. \n\nAlmost no body panels were carried over from the sedan. The plastic front fenders the doors or the rear fenders were different. The different headlights inspired an aggressive car, able to deliver strong performance. And, in most of the engine versions, that was true. Unlike the sedan, the coupe featured frame-less windows for the doors. The rear windows were fixed. \n\nInside, the dashboard was carried over from its 4- or 5-door siblings. But the similarities are ending there. In the back, there was a limited room, only for two passengers. The high, transmission tunnel that crossed the cabin from front to back, didn't leave enough room for an adult middle passenger. \n\nFor the engine and transmission, the 2006 3-Series Coupe, or E92 as it was known by the brand's enthusiasts, took most of them from the sedan version. But it was not fitted with engines lower than a 2-liter segment."

    "model_description": "BMW refreshed the 3-Series Coupe in 2003 and brought significant changes to the car's exterior and on the technical platform.For several years, BMW was the only important producer of a compact-segment coupe on the market. Mercedes-Benz was not focused on that area, and Audi was far behind. But BMW had a long tradition for the 3-Series coupe and had to keep it running.\n\nOn the exterior, the car received a new front fascia. Instead of the double-curved lower side, they featured only one and a straight, horizontal line. The apron was available either with an M-pack or standard, with a less-aggressive look. At the back, the car received a new, restyled bumper.\n\nInside, the carmaker installed a new steering wheel. On the center stack, BMW introduced an infotainment unit that included the navigation system as well. Depending on the trim levels and options, the carmaker offered power-seats.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW removed the two-liter inline-six engine. It was sad news for the 3-Series fans since all its predecessor featured one ever since the first generation of the 3-series. But they could choose from a 2.0-liter inline-four or a 2.2-liter inline-six instead. The 2003 BMW 3-Series was the last generation that used naturally aspirated gasoline engines. Unlike its four-door sibling, the coupe was available as a rear-wheel-drive only."

    "model_description": "BMW launched a new generation 3 Series Coupe in 1999, based on German manufacturer's latest E46 platform.The coupe's exterior design underwent important changes compared to its previous generation model, featuring a longer chassis, revised front grille, new spoiler (with larger air intakes) and redesigned headlights. \n\nAlso, the 3 Series Coupe featured a stiffer suspension than its saloon counterpart and challenged the Mercedes-Benz CLK and the Volvo C70 on the premium coupe segment. Some of the new features fitted into this 1999 3 Series Coupe included Automatic Stability Control with Traction (ASC+T) and Cornering Brake Control (CBC). This model received some slight restyling in 2003, featuring new wings, front bumper and front & rear lights.\n\nCompared to its predecessor, the E36, the E46 was built on a longer chassis and overall the car was longer, wider and lowers, changes that made the car even more stable and more powerful.\nThe safety equipment included dual front airbags, side airbags and curtain airbags for the front passengers, as well as ABS, ESC, traction control, cornering brake control and electronic brake force distribution.\n\nThe E46 coupe was offered with 5 engines in 1999-2000, all gasoline. (2.2-liter, 2x2.5-liter ,2.8-liter and 3.0-liter). The power ranged from 125 kW to 170 kW and the engines were mated to either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic transmission."

    "model_description": "The 3 series started its career in the '70s only in coupe form but evolved over the years into a full line of bodyworks.But the coupe was not dropped and, in the third 3-series, the coupe played an important role in the market. It was shown in late 1990 and the sales started in 1991.\n\nThe E36 was a complete change in the 3-series design. From the exposed rounded headlights to newly developed twin headlamps under the same glass, it was a big step and many fans didn't agree with it. But the car was better from any point of view. The new suspension, bigger wheelbase and bigger engines were enough to place the car on top of the premium compact-sized sedans on the market. And the coupe went a step further with its doors with frameless windows.\n\nThe interior featured a dashboard turned toward the driver, with accessible controls and a good layout. The low sitting position was very well received by the customers who were looking for a true sports car at a decent price. In the rear, there was enough room for two adults. Depending on the trim level and options checked on the list, there were front highly bolstered seats, heated and power-adjustable.\n\nUnder the hood, the basic engine was a carry-over from the E30, but that changed from the facelift model that happened in 1995. The top model, apart from the M3, was the 328i version, with a newly developed 2.8-liter unit. The standard transmission for the entire range was a 5-speed manual and a 4-speed automatic was offered as an option."

    "model_description": "In 1982 BMW showed the second generation of its small, two-door, compact vehicle, the 3-Series.The E30 was considered a milestone in the German car-manufacturer.\n\nIts design was simple. The straight lines, four rounded headlights and a slightly raked stance were part of its charm. It wasn't a car that shout about attention, but it was a car that gathered interest from everybody. It offered engines for every budget and every needs.\n\nEven if the coupe was offered with two doors instead of four, it featured the same wheelbase and the same overall length or height. The grille was flatter when compared with its predecessor, the E21. In 1987, a mid-life cycle refresh was added and the chromed exterior details were changed to black. The headlights and taillights had received a new design. \n\nFor the engine bay, the German engineers installed powerplants started with a 1.8-liter unit and up to a 2.7-liter version. The latter was built for economy and it wasn't the most powerful version. Apart from the M3 top-performer, the fastest version was the 320 iS that had a 2.0-liter engine with 192 hp. It was very close to the magical figure of 100 hp/liter value. \n\nThe car introduced few technical novelties for the 3-Series such as the turbocharged diesel engines and the all-wheel-drive system, which was available only on the 2.5-liter unit."

    "model_description": "The first generation of the 3-Series was introduced in 1975 and came after the successful BMW 02 Series, a car that wrote history in the German car company.And the first 3-Series was the most successful BMW series.\n\nThe motorsport industry in the early '70s was crowded with Italian, British, French and German cars. Swedish brands also had something to offer with. But while some car-manufacturers were more concerned about large coupes, grand-touring cars and supercars, BMW focused on light vehicles that could serve as daily drivers and also be able to offer some satisfaction on the tracks.\n\nThe first generation of the 3-Series featured the so-called \u201cshark-nose\u201d with a rearward angled front grille. The first models featured two rounded headlights. The 2.0-liter and above engines were fitted with twin-headlights design while the other featured just two round headlights. The three-box design vehicle was offered only with two doors and it was available in a top-cabriolet version that was built by the custom coach-builder Baur.\n\nInside, there was room for four passengers and, depending on the engine option, the instrument cluster featured a tachometer or an analog clock. The dashboard was tilted toward the driver position.\n\nThe car was offered with a standard 4 or 5-speed manual transmission and some engine options were offered also with a 3-speed automatic. The top-model was the 323i version that featured a mechanical fuel injection system developed by Bosch. The 323 was offered with a choice of three different manual gearboxes, one with 4 and two with 5-speed, one with a dog-leg pattern."

    "model_description": "When BMW introduced the so-called \"Neue Classe,\" it introduced a new generation of vehicles that eventually saved the Bavarian carmaker, and the 3.0 CSI was part of them.\n\nBMW introduced the E9 in 1968 with a regular, 2.8-liter carburetor engine. In 1971 it introduced two versions based on the same bodywork: the 3.0 CS and the 3.0 CSI. The latter was a daring move towards the fuel injection systems, which were not that common at those times. It was a checkpoint for the glorious 3.0 CSL, a car that won six European Touring Car Championships.\n\nWilhelm Hofmeister signed the car's design and created the unique shape of the C-pillar, later known as \"The Hofmeister kick.\" He made a streamlined bodywork with a raked-forward front fascia which sported four headlights and a black grille. In the middle, he placed the chromed trims for the \"kidney-grille,\" which was another basic design pattern used by the German brand. Thanks to the frameless doors, the E9 was considered a fake cabriolet. With all the windows rolled down, there was no B-pillar between the A- and C-pillars.\n\nInside, the E9 featured two bucket seats at the front and a bench profiled for two adults in the back. The carmaker installed safety belts for all four occupants. In front of the driver, the carmaker installed the four-dial instrument cluster, while on the passenger side, there was a wide shelf. A center console filled the space between the front seats and sported the buttons for all four power windows.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW installed an inline-six engine fed by a Bosch D-Jetronic injection system. It provided 200 hp, and it sent them to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual transmission. For the U.S. market, the German carmaker offered a three-speed automatic gearbox."

    "model_description": "The 3.0 CSL was the very first model designed and developed by BMW's Motorsport division. The 1971 BMW 3.0 CSL (Coupe Sport Lightweight) was based on the 3.0 CSi chassis & body and featured all-aluminum components, while being stripped of all 'unnecessary' trimmings or soundproofing systems. \n\nThis model was initially fitted with a 3.0L 6-cylinder inline engine delivering 180 hp that was later replaced (1973) by a more powerful 3.2L unit. The racing version of the 3.0 CSL received a high-performance 3.5L engine and a Getrag five-speed gearbox. The 3.0 CSL was lighter than its predecessor by around 400 lbs. The opening panels were made out of aluminum, and the steel panels were of a thinner gauge. The car did not have a front bumper and the rear bumper was a very light one, made of a black polyester. The power steering and the electric windows were removed as well.\n\n This model was produced in about 785 units until its discontinuation in 1975. BMW 3.0 CSL's racing variant scored some historical wins in the 1973 ETCC championship (beating Ford Capri for both drivers' and manufacturers' title) or the 6-Hours of Nurburgring.\nThe CSLs were offered in four distinctive colors: Colorado, Golf, Inka and Verona. All of the models produced were left-hand-drive and were not sold in the UK. \n"

    "model_description": "When BMW decided to enter the car industry, it bought the struggled Eisenach car factory in 1928 where the British car Austin 7 was produced under license.One year later, it showed the new model, the BMW 3/15.\n\nThe Eisenach car company sold the licensed Austin 7 under the Dixi name for the market. It was more of an assembled car from spare parts imported from the U.K. In 1927 the car was adapted for the European roads, with the left-hand-drive position. This is how the car was found by BMW when it bought the factory and it named it BMW Dixi.\n\nIn 1929, BMW installed Bosch dampers on the car and named it 3/15 where 3 was the taxation category and the actual horsepower. The car was available as a coupe, roadster and tourer. Also, some vehicles were sold as chassis to external coachbuilders.\n\nOne of the biggest problems of the car was that everything was measured in Imperial units and most workshops had only metric tools. BMW decided to change that and, in 1929, when it started to build the parts, it started to change the fasteners into metric. The first 3/15 was also named as DA1, which meant German Version 1. Further developments followed on the DA2, DA3 and DA4 models.\n\nUnder BMW management, the car received four-wheels brakes, unlike the Dixi who had only rear brake wheels. The engine was modified to increase its maximum power output to 18 hp. There was also a sports car named Wartburg, but it was discontinued when the Great Depression started in 1931. BMW discontinued the 3/15 in 1932 when the license with Austin expired."

    "model_description": "BMW engineers worked hard to develop their first automobile, the 3/20, which entered on the assembly line in 1932 after it ended the license-based 3/15 DA4 \"Dixi.\"\n\nAfter starting with baby-steps its automobile industry, BMW decided that it was time to walk alone. Its engineers were already made progress in developing a car from the ground up while they were upgrading the Austin 7 model built under license with the name BMW 3/15. The 3/20 might be considered as the first genuine car built by the German carmaker, even though there were obvious connections between the 3/15 and the 3/20.\n\nThe exterior was still similarly shaped as the Austin 7, but the carmaker mounted the headlights on a transverse bar mounted in front of the radiator, unlike the British-based model that had them mounted on the engine bay's sides. BMW built the 3/20 as a sedan with two doors, convertible, and roadster. Its chassis was not the same used for its predecessor, and it featured a longer wheelbase. The bodyworks were made by Mercedes-Benz. All models featured front-hinged doors and only one windshield wiper mounted in front of the driver.\n\nBMW offered the 3/20 with either two or four seats inside. Since their inspiration model was the Austin 7, it was still a small vehicle and difficult to use by four grown adults. It was more suitable for a family of four, with two children.\n\nTechnically, the 3/20 featured independent suspension in all corners, with a swing-axle in the rear. It was an unusual solution for those times but proved to be very useful. Under the hood, BMW installed an 0.8-liter engine that developed 20 hp mated to a 4-speed manual gearbox."

The German car-maker modified the engine to produce more power but it was just a step before their first designed and engineered car, the 303. Despite the Great Depression, BMW launched the new 303 in February 1933 with an elegant body style and rounded corners. The 303 was available in four choices: closed sedan, cabriolet, sport-cabriolet with two seats, and chassis. The car was an instant hit and was sold in 2300 units in just two years. By those times standards, it was a success.\n\nAt those times, there was normal to buy a chassis from a car-maker and the body from a coachbuilder and, while some worked with Spohn, BMW worked closely with Glaser.\n\nFor the closed sedan bodywork, BMW worked with Mercedes-Benz, who helped them create a good quality interior. The instrument panel featured just two dials for the speedometer and the fuel gauge.\n\nThe tubular chassis with rear axle and front independent suspension with a transverse leaf spring was features unseen on those times. The light construction and the powerful six-cylinder engine were strong enough to propel the car at decent speeds. The RM 3600 price for the sedan was smaller than the price asked by Mercedes-Benz for the 170 model."

    "model_description": "The BMW 326 Convertible was, basically, the open-top version of a respected two-door sedan, but it was pitted against its brother BMW 327 that was a faster, shorter and lighter vehicle.That's why is it so rare.\n\nIn 1936, the BMW dared to build its first four-door sedan and it was also offered as a convertible even though in those times the German car-manufacturer had already plans for new open-top vehicles. The convertible version was based on the same chassis as the sedan, which should have to decrease the production costs. But it wasn't a cheap vehicle and, but due to its quality and comfort, was sold well.\n\nThe outside featured flared, big front fenders and, between them, there was a different body for the engine compartment. The big, long hood was opened wither to the rear or via two side panels, An interesting feature was noticed at the windshield. It was split in two and the wipers were mounted on top. Due to this system, the windshield was opened from the bottom and tilted outside. \n\nThe chassis had some inspiration from the Citroen Traction Avant, with a torsion bar suspension at the rear and hydraulic braking system, the first to be used on a BMW car. The inline-six engine was of unusual construction, with the aluminum engine block and cast-iron cylinder head. The twin carburetor was an upside-down system and each was feeding three cylinders."

    "model_description": "A less-known version for the 1938 BMW 327 Cabriolet was the coupe, that was launched in 1938.It shared the same bodywork, but with some special modifications.\n\nThe 327 remained one of the last gems made by BMW before WWII. It was designed and produced as a sporty vehicle, in its both versions as a coupe and convertible. The coupe had rear-hinged doors and the windscreen wipers were mounted at the base of the windshield. But it had the same beautiful long hood and curved front fenders. The big, tall \"kidneys\" had a chromed rim and a black interior mesh. It worth saying that the car was mostly hand-built and all the body panels were protected from rust with a thin, hand-applied, tin layer. \n\nThe 327 Coupe featured a body-on-frame bodywork, with a revised front suspension from the previous BMW 326 and a rear live-axle that was also used for the 328 roadsters. The coupe was only RM 50 cheaper than the convertible and most of the buyers chose the open-top variant.\n\nThe straight-six engine was a masterpiece of its time with an aluminum-alloy engine and a die-cast cylinder head. The base engine featured a downdraught carburetor and produced 55 hp. There was another version with two carburetors and, for special orders, an engine with a different intake manifold and three, BMW 328 carburetors. The total output for that was 88 hp. \n\nThe 327 coupes were fitted with hydraulic brakes, which was an unusual feature for that era. The four-speed manual gearbox had a single-dry clutch."

    "model_description": "The 1936 BMW 328 was one of the most successful race-cars before WWII and it was considered one of the most important cars built in the XX-h century.BMW 328 was the only car that won the Mille Miglia in 1940 and it also won the Mille Miglia Classics in 2004. The list of its winnings was long and it included 1st place finishes even after the war. It was the supercar of its era with one of the most classic stylings ever.\n\nA long hood with two flared arches and a pair of headlights that were incorporated into the flowing design of the car was unusual for 1936. The slim and tall \u201cBMW-Kidney\u201d grille was already a brand image both on the tracks and on the streets. The short cockpit was for two passengers and the half-doors were there only to pass the regulations. The rear wheels were covered by flared and extended wheel-arches. Between them, the sloped trunk host the spare-wheel on top of it when the car was used on the streets. In the race, the competitors used to remove the fenders to lighten the car and the spare-wheel for the same reason.\n\nThe chassis featured an elliptical profile to decrease weight and increase strength. The excellent handling of the car came from its low weight of 830 kg (1830 lbs), front swing axle with a transverse leaf spring and the rear live axle. The inline-six engine was similar to the one found in the BMW 326 and 327 but featured a different cylinder head and three down-drought carburetors. That setup allowed the car to obtain 80 hp from the 2.0-liter engine. It was mated to a 4-speed gearbox. Depending on the race, the axle final drive ratio could have been changed either for acceleration or for higher speeds."

    "model_description": "The most luxurious car built by BMW before the WWII started was the 335 model.Its ambitions were to keep up with Mercedes-Benz models in terms of comfort, luxury, and performance.\n\nThe Bavarian company started to be noticed by the market, especially after the 328 roadster started to win races after races. It had won 100 races in 1937, including the British race RAC Tourist Trophy. The 326 model already got its own customers. Soon after the 326, the 327 coupe and cabriolet were also noticed for their luxury, performance, and comfort. The 326 had four doors and it offered comfort, but not too much performance from its 2.0-liter engine. Considering this, the carmaker decided to make a bold move into the luxury class, with a bigger engine and more comfort.\n\nThe 335 was shown for the first time at the London Motor Show in 1934. The car was 23 cm (9\u201d) longer than the 326. That increase was needed to accommodate the larger, 3.5-liter engine. With its raked and curved to the back front grille, the 335 resembled the same front fascia as the 327. But it was bigger than that model. While the 327 was available as a coupe and 2-door cabriolet, the 335 came as a 4-door coupe and cabriolet, plus a 2-door cabriolet.\n\nInside the cabin, there were more similarities with the 326 and the 327 with square dials for the speedometer, fuel level, coolant temperature, and an elegant clock in front of the front passenger.\n\nThe longer wheelbase and enhanced suspension made the car more comfortable than the 326 and the 3.5-liter, 90 hp unit with higher torque gave its customers the desired performance. A little over 400 units were built, from which 233 were four-door sedans."

The 550I adds a rear view camera and navigation with voice recognition, online information service and real-time traffic.\nOptional features include 20-inch alloys, Nappa leather upholstery, two power rear bucket seats instead of the 3-person bench, Dynamic handling package with adaptive dampers, 2 sport packages, heated front and rear seats, and a heated steering wheel. The luggage capacity was increased by 60 liters to a total of 500 liters. \n\nThe car is equipped with an 8-speed automatic transmission. RWD is the preset configuration, but each version is available with xDrive all-wheel-drive. The GT 5 series was more expensive than the BMW\u2019s X5 and X3."

    "model_description": "Based on the same platform with the BMW 7-Series, the 5-Series Gran Turismo was not as successful as anticipated by the German car-maker, mainly due to its look.The 5-Series Gran Turismo was the first four-door car built by BMW with frameless door windows. Its fastback look and tall stance were a mix between a sedan, a station wagon, and an SUV. And, apart from its large and generous interior, it was neither of them.\n\nThe car's design was the most debatable aspect. The front fascia resembled the 5-Series, but that was the only connection with the F10 5-Series. A tall greenhouse with the arched roofline and a swept-back resembled a fastback vehicle. It resembled the X6 shape but, while the SUV-coupe vehicle was successful, the 5-Series GT was not. A particular feature of the car was the twin-open tailgate, which could have been opened only on its lower part or with the whole rear windscreen.\n\nInside, there was one of the strongest reasons for someone to buy the GT version over any other BMW. Its long wheelbase allowed a spacious interior, with plenty of legroom for the rear passengers. Due to its high roof, the headroom was not a problem as well. The massive dashboard featured the infotainment display at the same level as the instrument cluster but enclosed under the same \u201croof\u201d. The center console hosted the iDrive controller and the automatic gearbox selector.\n\nThe 5-series GT was available with a choice of diesel and gasoline engines, with rear or all-wheel-drive. It was offered with a power ranged between 184 hp and 450 hp."

    "model_description": "After WWII, BMW tried to make its move and return to the automotive industry.And its first model for a limousine was a big car that almost buried the brand.\n\nThe BMW 501 could be served as a lesson for trials and errors. The BMW was finally cleared to build cars, stepping up from motorcycles and mini-vehicles such as the Isetta. The company engineers dig up for former good vehicles in the library and pulled out a chassis and the engine from the pre-war model 326 and tried to make a car. The result was a heavy, baroque design, vehicle. It had the name 501 and the nickname Baroque-Angel. \n\nThe 501 was intended to be used by the new upper-class managers from Germany. The direct competitor was Mercedes-Benz. The long, flared wheel arches and the rear-hinged doors provided excellent access to the comfortable rear seats. It had a strange technical solution for the gearbox that was mounted further away from the engine. The torque was sent to that via a short drive-shaft and from there on to the rear wheels. \n\nThe price was lower than the main competitor, the Mercedes-Benz 220, but the car was ready to be delivered only in late 1952. The delay of the delivery put the BMW in a difficult financial situation. To gain the lost ground, the Munich based company installed a V8 engine under the hood in 1954 for the 502 model, which was more of a 501 version than a new model. Both cars had poor sales despite the technical quality. The price to develop the vehicles and the new V8 engine was high."

    "model_description": "BMW launched the 502 coupe version at the 1954 Geneva Motor Show, aiming to create a sportier variant of the previous 501 model.Despite sharing its chassis and bodywork with the 501, this new coupe model was initially fitted with an innovative 2.6L V8 engine (built out of lightweight components) that delivered 100 hp. The engine was mated to a 4-speed manual gearbox. Later on, a 3.2L variant of this V8 unit was introduced as an option, setting a new output standard of 120 mph. The 502\u2019s engine was the first post-war V8 powerplant.\n The car's chassis was more robust and offered better ratings in terms of front/side collision, while the fuel tank was positioned in such a way that it minimized the danger of an explosion in case of an accident. Other differences to the 501 model were the exterior chrome trims and interior design as well as the obvious 2-door coupe shape, standard features such as individual front seats and fog lights.\nThe BMW 502 registered low sales due to its increased price, which was around four times the average salary in Germany. Both the 501 and 502 were nicknamed \u201cBaroque Angel\u201d due to their flowing design.\nThe coupe and the cabriolet models were designed by Baur, a respected coach-builder who was already acquainted with BMW\u2019s standards as he dealt with the BMW convertibles since 1930. \nBoth the 501 and the 502 models were discontinued in 1958, being renamed as BMW 2.6, respectively BMW 2.6 Luxus."

    "model_description": "A vehicle  that impressed the car industry back in 1956, the BMW 503 cabriolet was the first one  to feature an electric soft top as standard equipment.Its chassis was entirely made out of aluminum with  its design not following any trends from abroad, entirely produced and designed at BMW.\n\nThe cabriolet was the 50s\u2019 most expensive car, being the first one with a light alloy V8 engine that developed 150hp. The 503\u2019s top speed was at 190 km/h. Its price equaled the price of a single family home at that time.\nThe elegant cabriolet was a luxury car produced in 139 units only and not many could afford it, being bought especially by wealthy people such as factory owners or film stars. \nThe vehicle was awarded with gold medals at car shows held in Romes, Lisbon, Wien and Cannes for its original and smooth design.\n\nThe technology used for the 503 was rather simple, the car offering great comfort for long trips. Most of the technical parts were kept from the bigger sedans, the 501 and the 502 - the frame, the engine, the transmission and the axles were almost identical.\nIt seemed like the new 503 represented a turning point for the BMW design, shifting to a cleaner, simpler look with the proportions of a grand turismo - long hood and short rear end.\n\nThe interior of the 503 was beautiful and clean, with 3 round gauges and a metal dashboard, plus a few ivory colored buttons that completed the luxurious design.\n\nBy the late 50\u2019s, BMW got on the verge of bankruptcy and managed to save itself by producing small cars like the Isetta. Of course, none of them had the power of the 503, but were nevertheless more affordable."

    "model_description": "It was the first coupe built by BMW after WWII and it was a disaster in financial terms.It was built before the 507 roadster, which was another financial loss for the struggled German car-maker.\n\nThe war was over and the economy started to rise again. The American car-dealer Max Hoffman asked BMW to build a car to compete against the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL coupe and convertible. The 503 was introduced at the 1955 Geneva Motor Show and it was built as a left-hand-drive only.\nWith a design signed by Count Albrecht Goertz, the designer of the Datsun 240Z, the car was sold alongside the 501 and 502 sedan vehicles.\n\nWith the 503, the BMW said a firm goodbye to the pre-war forms, with tall and narrow engine compartments and curved, exposed fenders. The flush bodywork, with the doors and fenders aligned, was a modern styling. The long hood and short cabin featured four windows which could be lowered. It was more of a fake-cabriolet than just a regular coupe. The narrow and tall kidney grille was inspired by the last BMW coupe, built before WWII.\n\nInside, the 503 featured a luxurious interior for the era, with seating for four. It was offered with two different steering wheels, one with four spokes which looked like an X and another one with two spokes that evoked an airplane wing. The three dials on the dash were covered by a small lip on top. It was the beginning of the instrument cluster. A radio was mounted in the center.\n\nThe 3.2-liter V8 engine offered 140 hp. Unlike the 300 SL, which featured a direct injection fuel system, the BMW engineering team chose the classic carburetor system. The power went to the rear wheels via a 4-speed manual gearbox."

    "model_description": "The BMW 507 was created to improve the German car brand into the American Show-Biz arena.It was launched in 1955 and it made it into the Elvis Presley garage.\n\nIn 1955 BMW was still struggling with old engines, vehicles on old chassis and a tiny car named Isetta. It was far from reaching its glorious past before WWII. Their idea was to improve the general perception for the brand and for that, it offered a special roadster: the 507.\n\nThe main importer of the BMW brand in the U.S. was Max Hoffman, the same person that convinced Mercedes-Benz to produce the 300 SL Gullwing. He knew that the market was open for expensive flamboyant roadsters. The 507 was supposed to fill the gap and BMW hoped that they could sell 1000 units per year. The chassis was a shortened version from the BMW 501 convertible and the V8 engine was specially produced for the 507.\n\nWith its long hood and side vents behind the wheel arches, the 507 was received as a breakthrough model, with high performances and could fill the need for fast roadsters on the U.S. market. Along the 507, the same designer created the 503, which was a GT-coupe car.\n\nThe V8 engine was mated to a 4-speed manual gearbox and everything on the car was specially designed for the 507. Due to those reasons, the final price of the vehicle was twice as big as projected. In 1953, the Corvette was already on the market at a fraction of the price of the 507. The result was a huge loss for the BMW brand who had to pull the plug after only 252 vehicles were built between 1955 and 1960."

    "model_description": "BMW unveiled a life-cycle impulse on the 6 Series in 2015, four years after the F13 introduction on the market, and that affected both the coupe and the convertibles.The 6 Series nameplate was revived by BMW in 2003, after a 14 years hiatus, and it was an instant hit. Despite its controversial design, the car sold well, and eight years later, it resulted in a less-contested version, the F13 lineup. But even if this GT design suited it, it had to go through some changes. Moreover, the car had to be adapted to the new Euro 6c emission standards.\n\nOne of the most important changes was at the front, where the car received new LED fog lamps to accompany the full LED headlights. In addition, the bumper sported a new design with a wide center grille in the lower apron, flanked by two air intakes needed to cool the brakes. On the sides, the sculptured door panels and rear quarter panels formed a unitary, flowing shape, while at the back, the redesigned bumper featured corner-mounted reflecting stripes. The canvas roof was removable at a touch of a button and could disappear behind the cabin.\n\nBut a GT couldn't be upgraded without additional touches on the interior, where the drop-top 6 Series received new piano-black trims on the center console, around the climate controls. The carmaker offered the convertible fitted with either comfort or sport bucket seats. Also, there was room in the back for two passengers, separated by the tall transmission tunnel.\n\nA 313 hp turbo-diesel was specially built for European customers, while the U.S. buyers got only the twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter or the twin-turbocharged V-8. All versions were available with rear or all-wheel-drive and featured a standard eight-speed automatic gearbox."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced a facelifted version for the second generation of the 6 Series in 2007, even though there were little things to do with this grand tourer vehicle.When the German carmaker introduced the second generation of the 6 Series in 2004 after a 14 years hiatus, BMW's fans were more than happy. The coupe was launched in 2003, and the open-top version appeared at the 2004 Detroit Auto Show the following year. Its design was controversial, and everybody expected a significant change in the facelifted version that came in 2007. And yet, they were minimal.\n\nThe facelifted version came with slightly different headlights and a new bumper that featured thicker angled slats on its air dam. But the back of the car raised the most eyebrows with its downward lines and the small, corner-mounted taillights. Adding the third brake light into the trunk's lid was not enough to improve things. Not even the redesigned bumper fitted with broader reflecting materials could. But still, the open-top version benefited from four power windows and a generous power roof that could've been retracted under a lid between the rear bench and the trunk.\n\nOne of the most important upgrades on the interior was the gear selector, which was not a slider anymore and followed a sequential pattern. In addition, the gear stick looked more like a golf club than a standard shifter. Furthermore, the i-Drive infotainment unit received an upgrade, and later on, in 2009, it got an even better system.\n\nUnder the hood, the carmaker introduced a turbo-diesel powerplant, especially for the European market. Its high torque and excellent fuel efficiency made some purists forget it was an oil burner. The base model, a 3.0 gasoline-fueled engine, gained more power, and a 4.4-liter V8 powerplant was added to the list."

    "model_description": "The second generation of the 6 Series had received the much wanted convertible version.The original, 1977 model, didn't have that and most of the potential buyers just asked \"why\". But in 2004, they quit complaining.\n\nThe E64 6 Series convertible was the first of its kind in the BMW lineup. A soft-top Granturismo vehicle that could roll nice and quiet despite its big engine, or fast and loud with the throttle planted. Its design was a mix of likes and dislikes, mostly due to the design of the headlights. The front bumper featured a shark-like lower grille split in three and the small kidney grille on the upper part. On the side, the long beltline was nice looking, starting from the front wheel arches but suddenly dropped from the middle of the rear fenders.\n\nInside, tons of features made the driver happy, from the i-Drive to the head-up display offered as an option. The big, comfortable seats up front were electrically adjustable in all the possible ways. It had two seats in the back, but with limited legroom. But if nobody was seated there, a wind-stopper could have been placed over the rear seats. It was a very effective device, especially if the side windows were up. \n\nUnder the hood, there were three engine choices: an inline 6 and two V8. All were available with manual or automatic transmission, but only RWD."

But to keep the momentum, it changed it again with the third generation in 2011 and added a mid-life cycle refresh in 2015.

BMW also replaced the front bumper with a new one that sported a wide center grille in the apron flanked by two side-scoops for additional cooling needs. In the middle, on the lower part of the bumper, the carmaker installed the radar system for the automatic cruise control. On its sides, the 2011 model featured a chromed trim around the window line, while the 2015 model didn't. The facelifted version featured a new bumper design at the back, with reflecting red stripes above the middle section.\n\nInside, the 2015 model featured new piano-black trims on the center console, surrounding the climate control buttons. Its high-bolstered front bucket seats were covered in Dakota leather with an option for Nappa. But there was still not enough room for three passengers in the back or two tall adults for longer distances.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW installed Euro 6-compliant engines with either six or eight cylinders.

    "model_description": "BMW introduced the third generation of the 6 Series in 2011 as a coupe and, in the following year, as a four-door coupe named Gran Coupe.The German carmaker made the 6 Series as a Grand Touring vehicle that could provide both the look and the performances of a personal luxury coupe. \n\nIt was clear that, apart from the ferocious M6, all the other versions were personal luxury coupes. They were designed with elegant-looking lines but still a bit aggressive, like a kickbox fighter dressed in a suit. The 2011 model, or the F12, featured elliptic headlights swept up and back onto the front fenders. With a profile that showed a raked windshield, a short roof, and a sloped-down rear windscreen, the 6 Series confirmed its status as a grand touring car. \n\nInside, the carmaker made the front seats as comfortable for long journeys as they could. The high-bolstered bucket seats with multiple adjustments helped anyone finding the proper driving position. On top of that, the two-way adjustable steering column eased the way. The dashboard featured a floating-design 7\" infotainment screen on top of the center stack, with an option for a 10.2\" display and a rounded instrument cluster. A tall center console separated the front seats into two separate areas and sporting the gear-lever and iDrive controller. The carmaker installed a bench for two occupants in the back, but it was difficult to host someone there for long journeys due to the limited legroom and headroom. It was ideal for long trips with a trunk that could get up to 460 liters (16.2 cu-ft).\n\nUnder the hood, BMW installed a wide engine range, both gasoline and turbo-diesel, ranged between 313 hp and 450 hp with rear or all-wheel-drive."

    "model_description": "In 2003, after a 14 years gap, the 6 Series from BMW returned to grab the attention for the long-awaited GT offer from the Munich based car manufacturer.But that wasn't all.\n\nIn 2007, the BMW introduced a mid-life cycle improvement model for the 6-Series. There were some modifications both on the inside and the outside of the vehicle and, most important under the hood.\n\nIt needs a specialist designer to notice the differences between the 2003 and the 2008 model of the BMW 6-Series from the outside. The bumpers were different, with a deeper air-dam in the front and redesigned rear fog-lights. The headlights were changed but in such a way that it was very hard to tell. The rear lights though were switched to LED-type and the third stop-light was relocated from the rear window to the trunk-lid. \n\nInside, there were few minor changes for the climate control unit and an updated iDrive unit. On top of that, there were some buttons to change the gears but, somehow, the BMW engineers considered that it was OK to install both +/- buttons on each side of the steering wheel.\n\nThere were two completely new engines: a 3.0 liters turbodiesel unit for the European market which was badged as a 635d and another 3.0-liter gasoline engine for the 630i. The V8 was already replaced in 2006 and improved from a 4.4-liter to a 4.8-liter. The top-of-the-range was the mighty M6 with the biggest engine ever installed on the 6-Series: a 5.0-liter V10  naturally aspirated masterpiece."

The design was controversial due to the rear end, nicknamed by the fans as \"Bangle But\" where the fender lines were not matching the trunk-lid. But the most important step was done: the 6-Series was back.\n\nThe front fascia featured unusual small headlights for the size of the car. The big, wide, grille was one of the vehicle's signatures. An aerodynamically profiled bumper featured three air-intakes to help to cool the engine and the front brakes. The side sculptured doors and fenders increased the dynamic look of the car.\n\nInside, there was a luxurious GT-style vehicle, with two front bucket seats. In the rear, there was limited room for up to three passengers. The infotainment system was controllable via the rotary knob installed on the center console. \n\nUnder the hood, there were few engine options from 3.0-liter up to the mighty 5.0-liter V10 installed on the M6. The standard transmission for the base model was a 6-speed gearbox, while the 4.4-liter and the M6 were equipped with a 6-speed automatic and a 7-speed single-clutch, respectively."

    "model_description": "The BMW 635 CSI was the most powerful version of the first generation of the 6 series coupe at the time of its launch on the market in 1979.It was a coupe faster and more comfortable than other GT vehicles on the market.\n\nAfter the successful BMW 3.0 CS at the beginning of the '70s, the German company needed a replacement. Paul Braq designed a new vehicle based on the already existing platform of the BMW 5-Series, which allowed the use of 4 and 6 cylinder engines. But for a performance coupe, BMW didn't want to use an inline-four and chose only the inline-six units. Even though it was considered the two-door version of the 7-Series, it was a mix between the 5-Series platform and 7-Series design cues.\n\nThe first generation of the 7-Series and the 6-Series were designed by the same team and that is why they are similar in shapes. The shark-nose design and the descending trunk line were similar. But unlike the executive sedan, the 6 Series featured frameless windows for the doors and only two seats in the back. The dashboard featured a centers stack tilted toward the driver and the instrument cluster featured four dials. It was the same layout kept by the German car-maker for over two decades: coolant temperature, tachometer, speedometer, and fuel level. \n\nThe engine was a 3.5-liter inline-six with a broad torque range that helped the car pull in every of its standard 5-speed gearbox. The up-mounted gear-stick was one of its main advantages over other luxury coupes on the market. It was available with an automatic transmission as well, named 635 CSI A."

    "model_description": "BMW took a gamble when it introduced the first generation of the 6-series, but the sales of that magnificent coupe rewarded its hopes.The German carmaker had to retire the already old E9 series, and it didn't have a proper replacement for it. It had an excellent new platform from the first generation of the 5-series (the 1972 E12) and a new design language introduced by the 3-Series in 1971. Unlike the smaller sibling, the 6-Series was made as a large coupe with a grand-tourer inspiration.\n\nWith a design signed by Paul Braq and its fake-cabriolet bodywork, the 6-Series quickly became a very thought-after car. Mercedes-Benz didn't have anything to offer on the same segment, and its closest rival on the European market was the Jaguar XJS, which was pricier than the German coupe. Its rear-raked front fascia resembled a shark-nose, and the chromed, wrapped-around bumper made the car looks sporty.\n\nThe same team designed the first generation of the 7-Series and the 6-Series, and that is why they are similar in shapes. The shark-nose design and the descending trunk line were similar. But unlike the executive sedan, the 6 Series featured frameless windows for the doors and only two seats in the back. The dashboard featured a centers stack tilted toward the driver, and the instrument cluster featured four dials. The German carmaker kept the same layout for over two decades: coolant temperature, tachometer, speedometer, and fuel level.\n\nWhen BMW introduced the 6-Series on the market, it relied on a 3.0-liter inline-six engine fed by a carburetor and paired to a 4-speed manual. After the carmaker noticed the car's success, it decided to give it more power and more features to make it more appealing for wealthier customers."

    "model_description": "In 2015, BMW introduced a life-cycle impulse for the 6 Series Gran Coupe to comply with new emission regulations and brought a refreshed look.With the 6 Series Gran Coupe, BMW offered a proper answer for the Mercedes-Benz CLS. It introduced the four-door version in 2012, a year after its two-door stablemate. Three years later, the carmaker refreshed the entire lineup introducing new technologies and a more aggressive design.\n\nAt the front, the car featured new LED fog lamps under the full LED headlights. Its grille sported nine vertical slats on each side of the kidney grille, one less than on the non-facelifted version. A side-to-side \"mouth\" found its place on the lower side of the bumper. The flared wheel arches and the rear horizontal lines from the back of the car created the image of a wider car. That effect was enhanced by a chrome strip in the bumper trim. For the six-cylinder versions, the rear apron featured larger surrounds for the tailpipes.\n\nInside, the 2015 model featured new piano-black trims on the center console, surrounding the climate control buttons. Its high-bolstered front bucket seats were covered in Dakota leather with an option for Nappa. In the back, the carmaker kept the two-seat layout with a very tall transmission tunnel. Instead of a middle passenger seat, BMW installed a folding armrest.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW installed Euro 6c-compliant engines with either six or eight cylinders. A 313 hp turbo-diesel was specially built for European customers, while the U.S. buyers got only the twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter or the twin-turbocharged V-8. All versions were available with rear or all-wheel-drive and featured a standard eight-speed automatic gearbox."

    "model_description": "On the brinks of the world economic crisis in 2007, BMW showed the CS concept-car, a study that revealed a four-door coupe.But it had to wait for another five years to be released as a production vehicle named 6 Series Gran Coupe.\n\n\nWhat it was, it was a BMW 6 Series with four doors. Underneath the body, there was the BMW 5-Series platform, but the Gran Coupe was longer, wider and lower than that. After Mercedes-Benz CLS and the Audi A7, the Gran Coupe filled the German premium offer in this new segment of luxury four-door coupes.\n\nFrom front and rear, it was just a 6 Series with the same angry eyes and the LED signature in the headlamps. The wide air-scoop in the front bumper helped to cool the engine, while the \u201cBMW-kidney\u201d grille was wider but not tall. The sleek lines evoked speed and performance. And that what the car offered.\n\nInside, the luxurious interior featured bolstered seats, high-quality materials and an easy to read instrument cluster. In addition to that, a head-up display was offered as an option but, unlike other brands, the system projected the information on the windshield. The big, bulky, transmission tunnel separated the driver from its side passenger. BMW said that the car was a 4+1 people vehicle. It meant that four people could seat in comfort, but that \u201c+1\u201d should ride on the extended center console that went all the way to the rear seats.\n\nUnder the hood, there were few engine options fed with diesel or gasoline. An all-wheel-drive transmission was available as an option, while the base versions had rear-wheel-drive only."

    "model_description": "The 8 Series from the BMW came to replace the old and aging 6 Series, which was launched in the late '70s.It was the carmaker's first true GT vehicle and it is one of the best BMWs made in the '90s. It was a completely new car and the look was different than any other car sporting the blue and white roundel.\n\nBMW didn't have too many cars with pop-up headlights, but in the late '80s, this were the coolest feature Before the 8 Series, only the Z1 and M1 had had pop-up headlights. \n\nThe sleek design was typical for a GT vehicle, with a long hood, a spacious cabin, and a short trunk. But unlike other GT vehicles from that era, the 8 Series had 4 real seats. There was not a lot of room in the back, but for short distances it was OK.\n\nThe interior was ahead of its time. It didn't have a navigation system, but it had a complicated on-board computer and a very powerful audio system. The fine bucket front seats were made mostly for comfort, but they were bolstered to could keep their occupants still under hard cornering. And, with the optional M-Technic suspension, it was really fast on a twisty road.\n\nFor the drivetrain, BMW offered three choices: a 4.0 liter V8, a 5.0 liter V12, and a 5.2-liter V12."

    "model_description": "BMW refreshed the i8 sports car after four years since it introduced the model into its range.Besides the exterior update, it also brought significant changes to the drivetrain.\n\nThe German carmaker surprised the market with the i8 sports car. It was unlike anything else in its stable and offered the best of both worlds: performance and fuel efficiency. It also boasted several carbon fiber elements and an astonishing, comfortable, and luxurious interior.\n\nWhile the car's overall shape remained unchanged, some details differentiated the 2018 model year from its non-facelifted version. For starters, the headlights featured slightly modified LED daytime running lights. The coupe also received a set of \u201ccoupe\u201d badges placed on the C-pillars since the car also became available as a roadster. In addition, BMW introduced a new set of 20\u201d light-alloy wheels on the options list.\n\nInside, BMW offered ceramic, or carbon fiber trims on the options list, which was a first for the i8. In addition, the automaker offered a new, copper-colored upholstery. The 2018 model came with a touchscreen for the infotainment system, complementing the iDrive unit. Moreover, the head-up display received a shift-light function for the rare occasions when the driver wanted to manually change gears.\n\nBut the most important changes were under the skin. First, the battery size increased from 20 to 34 Ah, resulting in a longer EV mode of up to 55 km (34 miles). Thanks to this upgrade, the automaker could also increase the electric motor performance to 105 kW/143 hp. Last but not least, the turbocharged inline-three was used mostly to replenish the battery pack and less for moving the vehicle."

But the car was a masterpiece of engineering.\n\nThe sleek aerodynamic 2+2 coupe vehicle was a plug-in hybrid. It was launched where car manufacturers didn't want to risk too much on the recovering market after the world economic crisis. But BMW didn't care. They built something incredible. A low-weight vehicle, with a sports car look, enough elegance and claimed it is more of a daily-driver GT than a supercar. \n\nUnder the hood, there were a 1.5-liter turbocharged, 3 cylinders from a MINI that offers 230 hp. On the front axle, there was an electric motor that offered 130 hp. The result is a sportscar able to battle against a Porsche 911 with the fuel consumption of a cheap city car. The bodywork was made out of carbon-reinforced plastic (CFRP) and aluminum. These materials were taken from the racing department because they are very light and offer enough strength. \n\nThe sci-fi look of the car is continued with the laser headlights that can light-up 600 meters (2968 ft) ahead on the road."

It was the first mid-engined BMW since the mighty M1 from the late '70s. Its plug-in hybrid powerplant helped the car achieve impressive fuel efficiency and a decent electric-only autonomy. The Roadster came with the same platform but enhanced for more driving pleasure.\n\nAt the front, there was no difference between the i8 and the i8 Roadster. Both body versions shared the same front fascia with a narrow and wide BMW-kidneys grille. The LED-daytime running lights underlined its headlights, and on the lower apron, the car sported a grille to cool the engine flanked by side-scoops to cool the brakes. The big difference was noticed on the sides where the Roadster featured the same \"shoulders\" over the engine compartment, but without the big rear window between them. The fabric roof was power-operated and retractable in 15 seconds behind the car's seats, at speeds up to 35 mph (50 kph).\n\nBMW managed to keep the same doors as on the coupe version to enter the car, with the hinges mounted on the windscreen's pillars. The interior was similar to the coupe version but offered just two seats instead of four. Instead of the rear bench (which was too small for a normal-sized teenager), the carmaker installed a 100 l (3.5 cu-ft) storage compartment.\n\nAlong with the updated 2017 version, BMW increased the battery size so the Roadster could travel up to 33 miles (53 km) on electricity only. Under the engine compartment, it was the same three-cylinder turbocharged engine that provided 231 hp alone. Together with the electric motor, the i8 Roadster offered a total output of 374 hp."

    "model_description": "The very first Isetta was introduced to the large public in 1953.Designed as a short-distance purposed vehicle (or microcar), the Isetta was developed in Italy and assembled in several European countries (from Germany and Spain to France or Great Britain).\n\nDue to its egg-shape body style, this car was nicknamed 'The Bubble Car'. Two years after Iso Isetta's official launch in Turin, BMW designed an Isetta of its own, featuring the same exterior design but different components. It initially came with a 250 cc 4-stroke engine (based on the BMW R25/3 motorcycle) and a revised suspension. A year later, BMW introduced the Isetta Moto Coupe DeLuxe with redesigned windows and improved on-road performance.\n\nA BMW Isetta was used to smuggle people across the East to West Berlin and it's also the vehicle that helped BMW reborn after World War II. In 1955, the BMW Isetta became the world's first mass-production car to achieve a fuel consumption of 3 L/100 km (78 mpg-US).\n\nLater on, a new Isetta 600 version was launched, featuring a longer wheelbase (to accommodate up to 4 people) and a more powerful 582 cc twin engine. This model was discontinued in 1962 and was replaced by the new BMW 700. More than 160,000 units were sold worldwide."

    "model_description": "Founded in 1972, the BMW M\u2019s focus was to develop and build race cars.While all the models produced by 1978 were based on already existing BMW models, the BMW M1 was the first to be built from scratch: the chassis was made at Marchesi and the body work at T.I.R in Italy and were later sent to ItalDesign to assemble the interior. \nBMW had to partner with Lamborghini as they could not build the 400 street-legal units in the requested timeframe by themselves. The mechanical parts were mounted in Stuttgart. The M1 had a coupe body style and was also called the E26.\n\nThe M1 was produced to compete in Group 4 and was the first BMW model to have a center-mounted engine of 3.5-liter 6-cylinder gasoline, developing 277 hp and 243 lb-ft of torque. The reason why the engine was mounted this way was to allow ulterior racing tunning. The next BMW built with a center-mounted engine was the BMW i8, a car closer to our days.\n\nThe M1 remained one of BMW\u2019s rarest models and the most successful race car they have ever built. Only 453 units were built. The M1 was sold for only 3 years, from 1978 to 1981.\n\n17 years later, a BMW M1 Hommage Concept was launched, to celebrate the sports car\u2019s 30th anniversary. The concept raised the question if whether BMW would build a modern M1 or not."

    "model_description": "The 2007 BMW M3 was the last naturally aspirated M3 and the first that featured a V8-engine under the hood, apart from the very limited edition of the 2001 BMW M3 GTR.The fourth generation of the BMW M3 was announced right from the start to be available in three body choices: sedan, coupe and convertible. The later, named E93 on the BMW internal coding, featured a retractable hard-top that added some weight to the car but improved the fun factor.\n\nUnlike the regular 3-Series convertible, the M3 featured a different bumper with big air-intakes. On the hood, the manufacturer had to put a bulge to install the big, tall, V8 engine, which was higher than the inline-six unit on the rest of the 3-Series. The hood featured two air-vents on each side of the bulge, but only one was functional. Another pair of air-vents were on the side of the car, behind the front wheels, to extract the air from the wheel well. At the back of the car, there were four round exhaust and a diffuser between them. The three-piece hard-top could have been retracted in 22 seconds.\n\nInside, the M3 convertible offered the same space as in any regular 3-Series Convertible. Due to its longer wheelbase than its predecessor, it offered enough legroom for the rear passengers, but only two seats.\n\nUnder the hood, there was a 4.0-liter V8 naturally aspirated engine. It was mated to either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed automated gearbox. The latter had a better 0-100 kph (0-62mph) time due to a faster gear change time."

Its commercial success was so big that the car-maker decided to build offer M3 versions for the following 3-Series vehicles. The 2001 M3 (E46) was the third generation. While the E30 M3 was built in a little over 17.000 units, the E46 M3 convertible alone was sold in almost 30.000 units.\n\nThe aggressive look of the car was due to its rounded parking lights, named \u201cAngel Eyes\u201d even though they looked from the opposing team. The big bumper with a lower apron and wide grille was needed to hide the big radiator and various coolers. Two scoops on the hood allowed a part of the hot air to escape from the engine bay. On the sides, a pair of vents on the front fenders resembled, in a modern way, those found on the glorious BMW 507. The car featured a thicker A-pillar to reinforce the bodywork. From there on there was no other visible reinforcement on top of the body.\n\nInside, the M3 Convertible offered room for four occupants. The front bucket seats were fitted as standard. In the back, there was not too much room for long trips. The soft-top was completely retractable behind the rear bench. The dashboard and the center console were the same as for the coupe version.\n\nUnder the hood, the M3 Cabriolet was fitted with the same 3.2-liter S54 engine mated to a standard 6-speed manual. As an option, there was a 6-speed automated gearbox named SMGII, with a single-clutch system."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced the second generation of the M3 in 1992 but waited for another two years before unveiling the open-top version for it.The German carmaker introduced the third generation of the 3 Series in 1990, and its fanbase waited for the M3 version for another two years. Unlike its predecessor, who sported an inline-four, the E36 M3 boasted a six-cylinder powerplant. Although the open-top version of the regular 3 Series appeared in 1993, the carmaker waited for 1994 to unveil the M3 convertible.\n\nSharing its front fascia with the M3 Coupe, the Convertible version featured a lower air-dam that featured a center air-intake flanked by the rectangular foglights mounted on the sides, on separate clusters. On the sides, the carmaker added the M-specific aerodynamic package that showed sculptured side skirts profiled to lower the drag. At the back, BMW installed a black diffuser under the rear bumper and placed the dual exhaust on the left side of the car. Unlike the E30 M3 Convertible, which looked radical compared to the regular E30 Convertible, the E36 was more subtle.\nInside, the car was fitted with a pair of high-bolstered bucket seats at the front, separated by the transmission tunnel and the gearbox. The curved dashboard featured an instrument cluster similar to the one installed on the lower-spec 3 Series versions. At the back, the carmaker installed a bench fit for two, and it even underlined that by offering just two headrests.\n\nUnder the hood, the 3.2-liter inline-six was paired to a five-speed manual, but that was changed starting with the 1995 model-year when BMW introduced a heavily modified facelift for the E36."

    "model_description": "The facelift for the last naturally aspirated V8 BMW M3 was introduced in 2010 and it had to pay the price for the eco-trend but in an M3 way.It was more eco-friendly, but powerful as before.\n\nIn 2010 the world economic crisis was over and the money started to go again toward sport coupe vehicles. The M3 Coupe, as one of the best choices in the premium segment, had to come with something more than before. And it brought a mild refreshed look and few special versions.\n\nFor the front side, the car featured a black kidney-grille unlike the chromed one from the non-facelifted version. On the lower side of the front bumper, there was a carbon-fiber lip extension available. On the side, there was a new option for the light-alloy wheels design.\n\nInside, there were some subtle modifications to the already very appreciated design. On the instrument cluster, 8 LEDs shift-light were installed on top of the tachometer case. The control panel for the climate unit received the buttons for the heated seats, which were placed lower on the non-facelifted version.\n\nTo lower the CO2 emissions, the 2010 M3 was fitted with a start-stop system, which worked on both manual and automatic transmission. The Competition Package was introduced and it offered adjustable dampers settings, for those who were trying their cars on a race-track."

    "model_description": "In 2010, BMW produced the ultimate M3 coupe fitted with the largest engine ever installed by the German carmaker in a 3-Series.Some people knew the M3 GTS from the \"Need for Speed\" saga, where it was the trophy car was at the end of the \"Most Wanted\" game. In real life, the coupe was made by order only and built as a track-focused car. But BMW offered an option for the owners to get it modified and made it road-legal. The car also marked the 25th anniversary of the first BMW M3, the E30.\n\nBMW built the M3 GTS based on the regular M3 bodywork. At the front, there was a new front bumper with a carbon-fiber splitter at the bottom. There were no fog lights available, and all three grilles from the apron were functional, cooling the engines and the brakes. The light hood sported a power-dome in the middle flanked by two vents behind it. On the sides, the aerodynamically profiled side-sills were unique for the GTS, while at the back, a big adjustable wing sat on top of the trunk lid. Under the rear bumper, BMW installed a splitter and four exhausts.\n\nInside, the cabin was stripped down to bare necessities. It featured thinner interior door linings and a lighter center console. The carmaker removed the climate control and the stereo from the center stack, but they were available as an option. BMW removed the rear seats and installed an FIA-approved roll-cage inside the cabin, stiffening the chassis even further.\n\nBut the most important part of the car was the powerplant and the drivetrain. The 4.4-liter V-8 engine was tuned by BMW's motorsport division and sent its power to the rear wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox. For the suspension, the carmaker installed a fully adjustable coil-over kit. There was also a new brake system with vented and drilled discs in all corners to shorten the stopping distance."

    "model_description": "The last naturally aspirated BMW M3 was launched in 2007 and it was fitted with a larger V8 engine that was, surprisingly, lighter than the former six-pot that replaced it.And that was better for sound, power, and handling.\n\nThe bump in the hood, the vents on the fenders, and the lowered suspension will tell the difference between the M3 and the rest of the E92 BMW models. It was built for a purpose, to play the role of a grand-tourer, a sports car, and a race-track weapon. \n\nThe E92 M3 was launched in 2007 with a six-speed manual and an 8-cylinder engine. It was received with mixed feelings by the purists who were still crying for the original, 1986, E30 M3. But since then, the engine was doubled in terms of displacement and number of cylinders. When compared to the E46 M3, the last with a naturally aspirated six-cylinder engine, the E92 was a heavier car. But that wasn't a real problem since it had a higher torque on the lower revs.\n\nInside, the car was designed to offer enough comfort and pleasure of driving. The sport-bucket seats, with leather upholstery, looked stylish and premium. A classic BMW instrument cluster was paired with an infotainment display placed high on the dashboard and with the i-Drive controller on the center console. For the rear seats, there was some room for passengers. \n\nIt was the technical progress that helped the E92 M3 to run faster, being faster on cornering, and drift better. New suspension, a standard limited-slip differential, and a lot of electronics helped the car to achieve better performances than the model it replaced."

    "model_description": "The 2003 BMW M3 CSL was a special series, built on the basis of those three letters, which meant \u201cCoupe, Sports, Lightweight\u201d.It was an homage to the glorious 1972 BMW 3.0 CSL.\n\nThe \u201cCoupe Sport Leichtbau\u201d (Coupe, Sports, Lightweight) were the basic characteristics of the CSL models. The engineers took the standard vehicle and removed whatever they could to make the car lighter. After that, they replaced the body panels with lighter ones. The M3 CSL was produced only one year in a total number of 1383 units.\n\nFrom the outside, only a car enthusiast would tell the difference, but a bigger bumper in the front and a duck-type rear spoiler on the trunk lid were noticeable. A special set of wheels was offered especially for the CSL model. Some small \u201cCSL\u201d badges were installed on the front fenders on the exhaust grilles and one in the back. On the lower part of the front apron, there were some carbon-fiber elements.\n\nInside, the heavier front seats of the standard M3 were replaced with slimmer and lighter ones. They were mostly race-bucket seats with different upholstery. The rear bench was slimmer as well and featured a simple mechanism to take them out. Just in case the driver needs to go racing.\n\nUnder the hood there was an enhanced version of the 3.2-liter straight-six engine from the regular M3, but with more power. A standard SMG II (automated, single-clutch, gearbox) was fitted as standard. Also standard was the limited-slip differential. Due to all weight reductions it had, the car was lighter by 110 kg (243 lbs) than the standard M3 coupe."

This new-breed powerplants were mated with either an innovative SMG Drivelogic transmission, featuring steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters (rally-like), or a new 6-speed gearbox.

    "model_description": "The 1992 BMW M3 was the first M3 that featured a six-cylinder engine.Unlike its legendary predecessor, the E30 M3, it was available as a coupe, sedan, and cabriolet.\n\nThe unexpected success of the E30 M3 made the BMW board consider launching a second generation of the M3. The other M model, the M5, was very well received on the market so there was no reason not to pay attention to the second M3. This time, it was on the drawing board long before the E36 started production.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, the E36 M3 was not so obvious. It didn't have flared arches and a big wing in the back. It featured a different set of bumpers and aerodynamically styled sills. The rear-view mirrors were different too. Actually, the M3 didn't feature any spoiler or wing in the back.\n\nInside, there were some differences when compared with the rest of the E36 series. A set of sport-bucket seats was installed in the front and a different upholstery was used for the car. The M-badge was on the instrument cluster, and on the seats.\n\nIn Europe, the car offered 286 hp from its 3.0-liter engine, but in the U.S. if offered just 240 hp due to fuel adjustments and regulations. After 1995, the engine was increased to a 3.2-liter, which led to 321 hp for the European model while the U.S. spec model featured the same 240 hp but a bigger torque. The pre-facelift versions were mated to a standard 5-speed manual and after 1995 it was equipped with a 6-speed. An option for a robotized gearbox, named SMG was available for both versions."

    "model_description": "The BMW M3 E30 was the first M3 in history and it was the most successful touring car ever, with more than 1500 victories on its class.And the series model became a motorsports icon since its start, in 1986.\n\nIn order to be able to start in the touring championship series, a car should have been produced in at least 5000 units per year and the race model should have numerous parts in common with the production model. Those were the regulations and BMW struggled to find a way to get to the start. So, it built a race-car and then it made it suitable for the road and started to sell it. It was a blast, despite the fears of the sales department. \n\nThe E30 M3 was based on the standard E30 coupe version, but it was extensively re-worked. The C-pillars were different and the trunk was shorter. The front and rear fenders were enlarged in order to accommodate the new suspension and wider track. There were two evolution for the car, and one had adjustable aerodynamic elements such as an extension for the front apron and the angle of the rear wing.\n\nThe interior was fitted with sport-bucket seats and all the comfort needed for a pricey car. The dashboard, door panels, and rear trims were taken from the standard, non-M, version, with leather upholstery. An option for sunroof was available, but the car featured standard on-board computer, air-conditioning, and manual gearbox.\n\nUnder the hood it was a newly developed inline-four engine with twin-cam and 16 valves that offered almost 200 hp from the 2.3-liter displacement.  It was available with two choices of manuals, both with 5-gears but one was dog-leg type with different gear ratios."

    "model_description": "Designed as a track-car able to go on normal roads, the BMW M4 is the ultimate race car with plates, which you can drive daily and thrash around corners during the weekend racetrack.The car continues the tradition started more than 40 years ago with the mighty BMW 3.0 CSL \u201cBatmobile\u201d and continued with the E36 M3 GT and GTR, E46 M3 CSL and GTR (with a 4.0-liter engine), and E92 M3 GTS and CRT.\n\nUnder the hood, there is the same 3.0-liter six-cylinder unit in the normal M4 but with a substantial power increase. To increase the output, BMW used an innovative water injection technology raising the power up to 500 hp and 600 Nm (442 lb.-ft) of torque. This makes the BMW M4 GTS the most radical and dynamic model in the range. It can get a 0-100 kph (0-62mph) sprint in 3.8 seconds. The top speed is limited to 305 kph (189.5 mph). The transmission is via a seven-speed double-clutch gearbox, (M DCT). To lighten the car, BMW used lightweight materials, carbon fiber and CNC-machined mounts fixed to the CFRP trunk lid.\n\nThe light-alloy wheels are specially designed and are fitted with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires (front: 265/35 R19, rear: 285/30 R20), which are adapted specifically to the BMW M4 GTS."

Unlike the E34, the E60 was available with a left-hand drive as well. The E60 M5 Touring was not available in the U.S.\n\nFrom the outside, few details could tell to a bystander that the family-car station-wagon featured a V10 engine under the hood. For starters, there was the bumper design, aerodynamically profiled with an apron and side scoops for the brakes. On the front fenders, there was an exhaust air-scoop, that evoked the scoop on the BMW 507. The mirrors were different than those on the regular station wagon. In the back, four exhaust pipes were screaming under the bumper.\n\nThe interior had few differences when compared with the rest of the 5-Series Touring range. The M-badge was present on the tachometer and the steering wheel. The gearshift-selector had a different design, like the head of a golf club. Three buttons were on the center console, for various programs for the gearbox changing parameters.\n\nThe BMW M5 Touring was the fastest production station-wagon in the world at the time of its launch. It also was the only station-wagon with a V10 engine in it."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced a station wagon version for the second generation of the M5 in 1992, three years after its sedan sibling.The German carmaker looked like it didn't exactly know what to do with the most potent version of its 5-Series, but was learning. Soon it discovered that its customers were eager for a high-performance station wagon, and the 340 hp powerplant developed by M was the right choice. But it didn't want to rush it into production. The car shouldn't disappoint its owners nor its makers. Apart from the engine and transmission, there were several other parts to improve.\n\nWhen the carmaker decided to make the station wagon M5, the only way to do it was to hand-built it. The empty shell came at the BMW M Division, and there, the company's technicians and engineers assembled it. At the front, the front fascia was similar to its sedan sibling. It featured a unique front apron under the bumper when compared to other 5-Series touring. Also, a set of gray side sills lowered the car's profile. An additional lower lip spoiler completed the rear bumper. On top of the tailgate, the carmaker added a discreet roof spoiler.\n\nWhile the exterior was very subtle, the cabin rewarded its owner with high-bolstered bucket seats at the front and a 60/40 split-folding seatback in the rear. A speedometer marked to 300 kph (186.4 mph) was very optimistic, but the standard, 250 kph (155 mph) dial was not enough for the car's abilities. BMW sold it with a speed limiter, but many owners already knew how to override it. A specific M steering wheel with the three-color badge on the lower spoke confirmed the car's performance version.\n\nStarting with the 1992 model, the M5 received the new S38B38 engine, which provided 340 hp, and it was paired with a six-speed manual. Since the car was hand-built, the carmaker couldn't build too many, and in the end, it managed to make only 891 units."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced a mid-life cycle impulse for the M6 in 2014, which affected both the coupe and the convertible versions.While the first generation of the 6-Series was available only as a coupe, the carmaker changed its mind and offered it in a convertible version starting with the second generation in 2003. It continued doing that even for the most powerful version, the M6. In 2011, BMW introduced the third generation of the 6-Series, with an M-version in 2012. The entire range was refreshed in 2014, including the M6's open-top version.\n\nThe refreshed styling included a redesigned front fascia. BMW introduced a slightly refreshed front bumper with more aggressive styling. Its massive grille featured a surrounding edge that channeled the air inside the dam for a better cooling effect. The refreshed version received new LED headlights as standard. From its sides, the carmaker introduced a new set of light-alloy wheels with a seven-spoke design. \n\nInside, the M6 featured a new steering wheel with paddle shifters for the dual-clutch gearbox. Also, on the center console, the carmaker placed the specific M gear-selector. As an additional reminder, the instrument panel sported the M-badge on the black dial background. The Merino leather-clad interior and the sport bucket seats matched the car's exclusive look. Like its predecessor, the 2014 M6 convertible featured a power-operated roof, which could have been retracted or installed at speeds up to 25 mph.\n\nUnlike its coupe sibling, the M6 convertible didn't receive the Competition package. Its owners had only one engine choice, which provided 560 hp, 40 less than the most potent M6 Coupe."

    "model_description": "The second generation of BMW's M6 Cabrio was launched in 2012.Unlike its predecessor that offered a screaming naturally aspirated V10 engine, the 2012 version featured a twin-turbo V8. \n\nThe world of open-top performance cars could not be complete without a representative from the BMW. With tons of power and luxurious interior, the M6 was a good mix between a high-performance sports car and a roadster.\n\nUnlike the rest of the 6-Series, the M6 offered a meaner look. The chrome-rounded kidney-grille, the side M-badges on the front fenders, and the four exhausts in the back were part of the package. The 20\u201d light-alloy wheels were also fitted as standard. The enlarged fenders added some aggressive stance to the car. The headlights were offered as an option with LED. \n\nInside, the bolstered seats installed in the front helped the driver and the side passenger to keep their position while hard cornering. With the standard leather upholstery, the cabin looked luxurious. There were two seats in the back but without too much legroom. A rear windscreen was available to enhance the comfort of the front passengers, but it was installed over the rear seats.  \n\nThe magic of the M6 came from a newly developed V8 engine with two turbochargers installed between the cylinder banks, to reduce the turbo-lag. The gasoline direct injection system also helped for better performance. The differential was controlled by a computer and a multi-plate clutch system, that allowed a locking between 0 and 100 %."

The triple-layer soft-top ensured a rigid-top like ride experience, with thick insulation. With the roof up, the car featured almost the same silhouette as the coupe version.\n\nInside, the M6 was available in a 2+2 configuration. The front bucket-seats featured high bolstering to keep the occupants in place while hard cornering. The leather upholstery was carefully crafted to enhance the luxury. The M6 was supposed to be more of a GT than a sports car, but it managed to be more on the performance side.\n\nThe technology inside was at the top level.

A 6-speed manual was available in the U.S. The suspension was stiffened to cope with the high-performance engine."

    "model_description": "When BMW unveiled the mid-life cycle impulse for the M6 in 2014, it did more than just adding a few styling cues to the car; it introduced a special, more powerful version as well.The German carmaker introduced the first 6-Series in 1976 and lasted until 1989 when it was withdrawn from the market without a clear successor, until 2003 when BMW unveiled the second generation. This time, it continued the saga in 2011 with the third generation and refreshed it in 2014. But it didn't come alone. It brought the updated M6 and the new Gran Coupe with it.\n\nWhile the convertible and the Gran Coupe were additional versions, the coupe remained the true performer of the family. Even though it was more of a gran-tourer, it was still a performance car. The refreshed version received new LED headlights as standard, along with a slightly reshaped front bumper. From its sides, the carmaker introduced a new set of light-alloy wheels with a seven-spoke design.\n\nInside, the M6 featured a new steering wheel with paddle shifters for the dual-clutch gearbox. Also, on the center console, the carmaker placed the specific M gear-selector. As an additional reminder, the instrument panel sported the M-badge on the black dial background. The Merino leather-clad interior and the sport bucket seats matched the car's exclusive look.\n\nUnder the hood, BMW offered a Competition Package for the M6, which raised the power by 40 hp. As an option, the carmaker removed the speed limiter for this version, boosting the top speed up to 189 mph (304 kph). Unlike its regular M-sibling, the Competition Package version featured an active M Differential for better traction."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced the brand new M 635 CSI model on the European market in 1984.Based on the E24 platform, the new model benefited from BMW M1's 3.5L 6-cylinder inline engine with an improved output rating of 282 hp. As compared to its initial 'brothers' in the E24 Series - the 630CS and 633CSi - this version was equipped with a new set of wheels and a redesigned bumper. This model underwent some styling changes in 1988, when BMW revised model's headlamps and fitted the M 635CSI with a unique front bumper (for both European and North American market). This model was discontinued a year later, setting the mood for the all-new BMW 8 Series."

    "model_description": "The 2013 M6 was the car built for those who were looking for a performance coupe but they need to buy a 4-door sedan instead.Fortunately, the M6 Gran Coupe was not a compromise, but a solution.\n\nThe BMW 6 Series was launched as a coupe back in the late '70s and was built on the same platform with the 5 Series. That didn't change when the new generation was launched and, with the 4-door version named Gran Coupe, it was just more useful, not only appealing. \n\nEvery car built by Motorsport GmbH was special. And their designers had to show that. Some models were more subtle, such as the E39 M5 while others were just striking, like the M3 GTR. Somewhere in between, there was the M6. It looked business, but it wasn't flamboyant. The same with the 2013 M6 Gran Coupe. A redesigned front bumper with larger air-intakes was present. In the rear, the four pipes under the bumper showed that the car was not just for the show. \n\nInside the cabin, there were four seats available, with bucket-seats upfront and individual seats in the rear separated by an extended center console. The whole car was built like a true Granturismo vehicle, except that it had 4 doors instead of two. \n\nRegarding the performance, it was in the same league with its M5 brother, with which it shared the technical platform. Basically, the M6 Gran Coupe was an M5 in disguise."

    "model_description": "It was the first BMW Z in history and it shared its main components with the successful BMW 3-Series E30.It was a pure roadster with huge imagination from its designers.\n\nIn the mid-'80s, BMW started to think about a revolutionary car. Something that nobody ever did. The idea was to revive the BMW roadster family, a category where the German car-maker was famous before WWII. At that time, there was only one convertible in its stable, the 3-Series. Then, in 1988, the Z1 was introduced to the market.\n\nThere was not a single panel carried-over from the 3-Series. The flat and low hood with narrow headlights were covered by a clear-lens. The magic was from the sides where the flared fenders attracted attention, as long as the doors were closed. The Z1 was the only car in the world to feature doors that open vertically into the body. They were sliding down to open and up to close. The rear deck was flat and short.\n\nThe cabin featured two bucket-seats in the front, separated by a center console and the transmission tunnel. On the center stack, the constructor placed the controls for the audio system and stereo. The instrument cluster was slightly different than the one found in a BMW 3-Series but featured the same arrangement of the dials.\n\nThe BMW Z1 was more of a concept car that made it into production. It was offered in only one configuration of engine and transmission: an inline-six 2.5-liter engine mated to a 5-speed manual."

    "model_description": "BMW introduced an M version for its nimble little roadster Z3 in 1997 and offered it on both sides of the Atlantic, but with different power levels.Basically, it was just another Z3 with a more powerful engine. But there was more than that. There were some visual upgrades and technical improvements that made the M-Roadster more desirable than its less-powered siblings.\n\nThe exterior benefited from a new front bumper that featured a lower spoiler. In addition, both the front and rear fenders were wider to fit the larger wheels and tires. In addition, the front fenders' louvers got a chromed horizontal slat, resembling the legendary BMW 507 from the late '50s. At the back, the quad exhaust system expressed in a vocal way the sound of the six-cylinder engine.\n\nInside, the Z3 M-Roadster received more standard features than its less-powered siblings. The leather-wrapped and heated high-seatback bucket and the power-folding roof were offered as standard. In addition, a better sound system and an AC unit were also present.\n\nWhen it was introduced, the M-Roadster received the 3.2-liter S52 engine carried over from the E36 M3 that produced 321 PS (316 hp) for the European customers, while the American version featured the S50 powerplant that offered just 240 hp (243 PS). Later on, in 2001, the car finally received the improved S54 powerplant that provided similar power on both sides of the Atlantic. All versions were paired with the same five-speed manual, and the power went to the rear via a limited-slip differential. In addition, the M-Roadster got better brakes and stiffened suspension than its siblings."

    "model_description": "The Z3 was the first vehicle built by BMW exclusively outside Germany and it was the first mass-produced Z-series model.It was the first vehicle built by the German car-maker to be featured in a James Bond movie franchise.\n\nThe predecessor of the BMW Z3 was the Z1. There was not any Z2 on the market. The Z3 was based on a mixed platform based on the E36 3-Series model, but with the rear axle taken from the E30 due to its compactness.\n\nZ3 was a typical roadster with a long hood, short cabin, and even shorter rear deck. Its rounded form and wide headlights covered by a clear-lens cover attracted a lot of customers. It was produced until 2003. On the front fenders, there was an exhaust vent with four slats, that resembled the BMW 507 roadster.\n\nInside, there was a two-seat layout with a big center console between the occupants. The central stack was slightly tilted toward the driver. With the dials and gauges carried-over from the E36 model, the Z3 was fit for sporty driving.\n\nInside, it offered sport-bucket seats for both occupants. On the center stack, BMW installed a stereo and the controls for the air-conditioning unit. The bucket-seats featured high bolstering to support the occupants while fast cornering.\n\nEven if it featured a mixed platform/drivetrain, the Z3 was a fast and nimble car. It was offered with a choice of engines ranged between 1.8-liter and 2.8-liter before the facelift. In 1999 the car went through a mid-life cycle refresh and received some updated engines. The 2.0-liter inline-six was replaced by a 2.2-liter, and the 2.3-liter was upgraded to a 2.5-liter, while the 2.8-liter was increased to 3.0-liter. The M versions were a different chapter."

    "model_description": "Designed to carry two passengers and some luggage at a fast pace, the 2006 BMW Z4 M-Coupe was a three-door fastback vehicle, based on the Z4-roadster model.BMW had a big success with the Z3 M Coupe, even though it was designed as a shooting-brake. For its successor, the Z4 M-Coupe, it decided to change the strategy. While the Z3 Coupe was developed by a group of enthusiast BMW engineers, the Z4-Coupe was part of the Z4 project since the beginning.\n\nWith its low hood, raked A-pillars, and sloped-back roofline, the Z4 Coupe inspired force, speed and passion. It wasn't a car for someone to bring its kids from school. It was bad for moving out as well. But it was great to set a lap-time over a race-track. The big tailgate in the back was unusually raked, especially for a BMW. The M version featured a quad exhaust, with the pipes mounted on the outside of the rear bumper, to make the car looked wider.\n\nInside, the leather upholstery was a standard fit on the sport-bucket seats. With a high center console between the occupants, the Z4 Coupe amplified the sensation of a driver's car, which it was. The instrument cluster was inspired by the M-versions, with a binocular style design. Between the individual \u201ctunnels\u201d for the speedometer and tachometer, the Z3 M-Coupe was fitted with an LCD as well.\n\nUnder the hood, the sport-compact coupe was fitted with the same E46 M3 engine. The 3.25-liter, 6-cylinders unit, offered the same power as its bigger brother."

    "model_description": "With an exterior look created by a Danish designer, the Z4 was fun to drive and affordable compared to other competitors in its class.Reaching its 4th generation, the Z4 came with a fresher design that appealed to many of the brand\u2019s fans.\n\nThe Z4 kept some of the references of an historical car, such as the large hood and the sloping roof.\n\nNot only the exterior was attractive, as the new engines boasted even more power, reaching 215 hp with the 3.0-liter power plant. The fuel consumption was also reduced compared to the previous generation of the engines.\n\nAvailable as a 2-seat roadster or a coupe for 2006. The coupe had a fixed roof that improved the body\u2019s rigidity, thus also enhanced overall handling. The styling was even more appealing.\n\nThe cabin featured a simple cockpit and clean, easy to use controls. Wood trims were also available, however, the standard metallic trim was a real eye-catcher.\n\nSafety wise, the Z4 came with antilock disc brakes and a stability control system. Also, side airbags, active knee protection and rollover protection were included.\n\nWhile the Z4 earned a 3-star rating for side-impact, it managed to score 5 stars out of 5 for frontal impact.\n\nFun to drive, not very expensive, and extremely stylish, the Z4 seemed to be a complete package for the passionates."

    "model_description": "The glorious BMW 507 is like the Phoenix bird that reborn in the shape of this magnificent roadster named Z8.It is one of the most beautiful homage-cars ever made and, certainly, is the biggest homage production vehicle built by the German carmaker.\n\nFirst, it was shown as a concept car in 1997 at the Tokyo Motor Show bearing the name Z07. But the final name was Z8. It was a 2-seat luxury roadster. The kind of vehicle someone will buy to enjoy the road, not the destination.\n\nThe design is a mix of the long hood, small cabin, and short rear end. The front fascia features a different design for the grille with large, rather than tall,  BMW-kidneys. The theme inspiration was, obviously, the magic 507 roadster from 1956-1959. The side vents from the front fenders are inspired by the same historic vehicle. \n\nUnder the hood was the best engine BMW had at that time, the 4.9-liter V8 unit from the E39 BMW M5. It offered 400 hp and 500 Nm (369 lb-ft) of torque and it was mated to a 6-speed manual. The rear axle was equipped with an LSD for better sprints. Its performance was matched only by its luxurious interior, with leather, aluminum, and wood. It was the car that stole the show when it was launched. One of the best designs ever made by a team of designers leads by Chris Bangle."
